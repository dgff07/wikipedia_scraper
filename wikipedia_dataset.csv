"Kesar| Balaji Telefilms television series| StarPlus original programming| Indian television series| 2004 Indian television series debuts| 2007 Indian television series endings| Television shows set in Punjab, India| ","Kesar (saffron) is an Indian television serial that aired on Star Plus from 19 April 2004 to 31 May 2007. The story follows the life of a young girl named Kesar.\nThe series was supposed to go on air as Karvachauth on Zee TV. However, as things didn't work out between the channel and production house, it was later granted permission by Star Plus and it went on air as Kesar.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nKesar (Nandini Singh) is a traditional Punjabi girl living with her large extended family in a village. She gets an offer of marriage from the wealthy Maliya family, living in a big city. Kesar marries Rudra (Nikhil Arya), the son of the Maliyas. She tries her best to cope with the sophisticated urban lifestyle of her new family. But soon she finds herself trapped in a web of deceit. It is revealed that Rudra and his mother Pam have conspired against the innocent Kesar for the sake of some valuable inheritance. Kesar's life goes through a great deal of turmoil. She finds support from Rudra's friend Abhi, who loves her selflessly. But Abhi dies a tragic and early death. His heart is transplanted into the body of Harman (Yash Tonk), who begins to experience the same feelings of love for Kesar. Meanwhile, Kesar has given birth to Rudra's daughter Muskaan. Rudra dies in a bomb blast. After many more troubles, Kesar decides to marry Harman. However, they are separated by adverse circumstances.\nGoing through these vicissitudes, Kesar gets a new face and identity as Kavita (played by Prachi Shah). She marries Police Commissioner Arjun Gill and brings up Abhimanyu, his son from his first marriage, as her own. She continues to miss her daughter Muskaan and her adopted son Krish. Later on, Kesar is reunited with her daughter Muskaan. The secret that Kesar and Kavita are the same person comes out before everyone. Kesar continues to live with Arjun  and Muskaan. Krish lives with Harman. Harman is married to Nupur but remains good friends with Kesar.\nNupur becomes jealous of Harman and Kesar's relationship. Nupur tries to kill Kesar, but instead hurts Harman and he became blind. The only person to know this is Nupur and Harman's daughter Khwaish. Krish meets Khushali, and they fall in love. Muskaan and Rohan meet and fall in love too. On their engagement night, Kesar finds out Rohan's real name is Ajay and he was married before. Krish and Khushali get engaged but Muskaan and Rohan do not. Rohan leaves the house but tells everyone that he had already informed Muskaan about this truth in a CD. However, Muskaan never managed to watch it. Later, the misunderstanding is cleared up. Muskaan decides to get back with Rohan, but on her engagement night, she is almost strangled to death. The person who wants to kill Muskaan is Naina, her wedding planner. Naina has loved Rohan for a long time but he does not love her. On Muskaan and Rohan's wedding day, police arrest him for killing his first wife. Naina is actually the one who has killed Rohan's first wife. She gathers evidence against Rohan and shows it to the police, so that his marriage will be delayed. Kesar and Arjun support Rohan. They compel Naina to admit that she killed Rohan's first wife. Naina then commits suicide.\nMuskaan and Rohan get together. Then, on the day of their marriage, Muskaan refuses to marry Rohan. Abhimanyu is in love with Muskaan and has confessed his love for her. Then he rapes her. This matter is taken to court. Meanwhile, Nupur tells Harman that she is the reason behind his going blind. Nupur gets shot and dies. Then, one day, Arjun tries to kill Harman. The reason is that Arjun is jealous of Harman's friendship with Kesar. However, Harman tells Arjun that his eyes have healed and he can see. Arjun is shocked to hear this. Kesar then brings the police and they arrest Arjun. Meanwhile, Muskaan and Rohan have got married. But Rohan beats up Muskaan, because he thinks that she and Abhimanyu are having an affair. When Rohan realises that it is not so, he apologises to Muskaan, but she doesn't forgive him. Muskaan and Kesar then move in with Harman, Krish, Khushali and Khwaish. They all live happily in Harman's house.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nNandini Singh as Kesar Rudra Maliya  / Kesar Abhinav Pandey / Kesar Rudra Maliya\nNandini Singh as Dr. Kangana Husband Dr Rudra Maliya (Kesar's Look Alike)\nPrachi Shah as Kesar Abhinav Arjun Gill / Kavita Face Surgery\nEijaz Khan as Abhinav (Abhi) Pandey\nYash Tonk as Harman Khanna\nNikhil Arya as Rudra Maliya\nSandiip Sikcand / Shakti Singh as Parmeet\nIndira Krishnan as Teji\nMadan Joshi as Dharam Maliya\nSurekha Sikri as Saroj Dharam Maliya\nKitu Gidwani / Natasha Rana as Pam Vikram Maliya\nRocky Verma as Inspector Yashwant Patil\nKaran Patel as Ryan Sood\nKanika Kohli as Nitika Maliya / Nitika Ryan Sood\nHiten Tejwani as Abhinav (Abhi) Pandey\nNisha Rawal as Binita\nAleeza Khan / Ashita Dhawan as Neha\nGunjan Walia as Riya Maliya\nShubhangi Gokhale as Harman's Aunt\nKhyaati Khandke Keswani as Katrina Rudra Maliya\nShivalika Sharma as Nupur Harman Khanna\nNishant Shokeen as Aseem\nVineet Sharma as Shivam\nIqbal Azad as  Police Commissioner Arjun Gill\nShweta Rastogi as Muskaan Maliya\nAmit Dolawat as Krish Maliya\nAshish Sharma as Abhimanyu Gill\nGunjan Vijaya as Khwaish Khanna\nAnkita Bhargava as Khushali\nPoonam Gulati as Naina\nVishal Watwani as Anand Pandey (Abhinav's Younger Brother)\nPratima Kazmi as Shakuntala Pandey (Abhinav & Anand's Mother)\nSanjay Batra as Vikram Maliya\nSonali Verma as Reema Vikram Maliya\nJaya Bhattacharya as Reema Sood\nKavita Kaushik as Kadambari Abhinav Pandey\nNasirr Khan as Komal\nAnas Rashid as Dr. Sahil\nMonalika Bhonsle as Shalini Sood\nMazher Sayed as Dr. Walia\nShweta Tiwari as Prerna\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKesar at IMDb\nOfficial website on TV Asia\nOfficial website on STAR Plus"
"MMP14| Genes on human chromosome 14| Matrix metalloproteinases| EC 3.4.24| Human chromosome 14 gene stubs| ","Matrix metalloproteinase-14 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the MMP14 gene.\n\n\n== Function ==\nProteins of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. Deficits in MMP14 leads to premature aging, short lifespan, and cell senescence in mice, suggesting an important role of MMP14 in extracellular matrix remodeling during aging. Most MMP's are secreted as inactive pro-proteins which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases.\nHowever, the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the membrane-type MMP (MT-MMP) subfamily; each member of this subfamily contains a potential transmembrane domain suggesting that these proteins are tethered to the cell surface rather than secreted.\n\"
"Omandongo| Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Mission mission stations in Ondonga| Oshikoto Region| Geography of Namibia| ","Omandongo is an unpopulated place in the Onayena Constituency in the Oshikoto Region in Northern Namibia, and the region which used to be called Ovamboland.\nThe Finnish Missionary Society began its missionary work in Omandongo in 1870. This was the first mission station for Finnish missionaries in the whole world. It was occupied by Finnish missionaries during 1870\u201388.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first missionaries of the Finnish Missionary Society arrived in Omandongo on 9 July 1870 from Otjimbingwe in the Hereroland via Omaruru. Omandongo was part of the kingdom of the King Shikongo of Ondonga.\nWhen the Finns arrived there, there was one structure at Omandongo, a house that had been built by Frederick Green, assistant to the merchant Andersson. It had been donated to Carl Hugo Hahn of the Rhenish Mission, and he in turn gave it to the Finns.\nThe Finns who arrived in Omandongo were the following:\nNotes:\na Note: In official works of history the first term of these missionaries is given as having begun in 1868, because they arrived on 30 December that year in Cape Town and on to Stellenbosch on the same day.b Piirainen acted during 1874\u20131910 as the FMS representative in Omaruru in Hereroland.The Omandongo mission station had to be abandoned in late September or early October 1888, because of the despotic behaviour of Prince Nehale of Ondonga. His men murdered a South African merchant named William Jordan practically in the yard of the mission station. Nehale\u2019s men also tried to \u201cpurchase\u201d an ox cart from the Finns, apparently offering nothing as compensation. The Finns then fled to King Kambonde in Olukonda.\nIn Ondonga, the work of the missionaries soon expanded so that several new mission stations were founded. These were Olukonda (1871\u2013), Oniipa (1872\u201376, 1888\u2013), Ondjumba (1872\u201376) and Omulonga (1874\u20131888).Later also the following mission stations were founded in Ondonga: Ondangwa (1890\u20131913, from 1915 on a government station) and Ontananga (1900\u2013), Onayena (1902\u201306, 1907\u2013), Oshigambo (1908\u2013) and Onandjokwe (1910\u2013).Oniipa, Onandjokwe and Oshigambo had the longest life as mission stations. (The end of this history is not given here, since the sources used do not extend to the end of this the time period. These former mission stations continue as important centres of the activities of the ELCIN church.)\n\n\n== Festive occasions ==\n\n\n=== 30 year celebrations ===\nThe 30th anniversary of the arrival of the Finnish missionaries was celebrated at Olukonda, since Omandongo had been abandoned already years earlier. The festivities were conducted on 7 July 1900. Among those present was the director of the Finnish Missionary Society, the Rev. Jooseppi Mustakallio. The festivities were conducted out of doors, and there were 600 people present.\n\n\n=== Centennial celebrations ===\nThe centennial celebrations of missionary  work in Ovamboland were held at Omandongo in July 1970. There was a large wooden cross at the site, and the first number was a re-enactment of the arrival of the missionaries 100 years earlier. Several male missionaries, with their safari helmets on, acted the roles of the original arrivals on ox carts. Students of the Engela Parish Institute acted the part of the indigenes.It was estimated that at least 5500 persons participated, since there was a special badge on sale and this was the number of badges sold. But many people also were present without badges, according to various estimates 1000 persons or even 2000 persons.\nThe liturgy of the festive service was conducted by Mikko Iham\u00e4ki and Bishop Leonard Auala, and the sermon was held by Kleopas Dumeni. The festivities were led by the Rev. Matias Ngipandula.28 speeches were held at the festivities, 15 of which were interpreted to other languages. Seven choirs performed, and they sand altogether 18 songs. Among the performers was also the brass band of the Rhenish Mission youth. Five plays were also performed during the festivities.The festivities had an ecumenical aspect, as several Christian denominations were represented, among the not only Lutheran Ovambos but also Lutheran Hereros, belonging to a different church, as well as the Reformed Christian, Anglicans and Roman Catholics. The government of South Africa was represented by Chief Commissar J. M. de Wet, who emphasised that the Ovambos, the Boers and the Finns must work together in order to improve the situation of the OvambosEverything went peacefully, and the biggest problem was caused by a couple of scorpion stings.The wooden cross at the site has since been burned, apparently as a wanton act.\n\n\n== Finns buried in Omandongo ==\nHenrik Rautanen (d. 1880).\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPeltola, Matti (1958).

It consists of a bronze rendition of Cort\u00e9s designed by Eduardo Barr\u00f3n on top of a stone pedestal.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nThe first one to come up with the idea of erecting a monument to Cort\u00e9s in Medell\u00edn was Carolina Coronado, formulating it as early as 1845, predating a 1858 public petition. However the realization of such plans would take decades. The project was eventually awarded to Eduardo Barr\u00f3n. The model of the statue was sculpted in Rome, although the bronze was cast in Barcelona. It was funded by the Provincial Deputation of Badajoz and the Spanish State. Meanwhile, the bronze, obtained from cannons, was financed by Carlos Groizard y Coronado.\n\nThe bronze statue of Cort\u00e9s is depicted wearing armor, stepping on some Mexica idols while raising the banner of the Cross.

In the 1980s, AST designed add-on expansion cards, and toward the 1990s evolved into a major personal computer manufacturer. AST was acquired by Samsung Electronics in 1997, but was forced to close in 1999 due to a series of losses.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Expansion cards ===\n\nAST's original business was the manufacture and marketing of a broad range of microcomputer expansion cards, later focusing on higher-density replacements for the standard I/O cards in the IBM PC. A typical AST multifunction card of the mid-1980s would have an RS-232 serial port, a parallel printer port, a battery-backed clock/calendar (the original IBM PC did not have one), a game port, and 384 KB of DRAM (added to the 256 KB on the motherboard to reach the full complement of 640 KB) - marketed under the product name 'SixPakPlus'. A similar expansion card was produced for the 8-bit Apple II, named the AST Multi I/O, which offered a serial and parallel interface, plus a battery-backed clock/calendar.\nIn 1987, AST produced a pair of expansions cards for the Apple IIGS computer: The RamStakPlus, a dual RAM/ROM memory expansion card; and the AST Vision Plus, a real-time video digitizer card. The latter card was eventually sold to Silicon & Software and licensed and sold through Virtual Realities (and later LRO and then Alltech Electronics). AST Research also produced for the Macintosh line the Mac286, a pair of NuBus cards containing an Intel 80286 and RAM, allowing a Macintosh to run MS-DOS side by side with its existing operating system. These cards were announced in March 1987 alongside Apple's Macintosh II line. The product line was eventually sold to Orange Micro, which developed the concept further.\n\n\n=== Personal computers ===\n\nAs PC manufacturers improved the integration of peripheral controllers on their motherboards, AST's original business began to shrink, and the company developed its own line of PCs, for the desktop, mobile, and server markets.\nAST was one of the members of the Gang of Nine which developed the EISA bus.\nIn 1992, AST became a Fortune 500 company at place 431.\nAST computer's reliability was considered close to that of quality leaders Compaq, Gateway, and IBM. AST gained a decent share of the PC market, but never came close to overtaking Compaq and Dell. During 1992\u20131995, AST owned the largest market share in China with Legend (now Lenovo) as the largest local reseller of AST computer.\nIn 1993, Radio Shack sold its computer manufacturing division to AST, and in 1994 they reached a deal to sell AST computers in Radio Shack stores. A year later, the electronics chain started selling IBM-brand computers instead.\n\n\n=== Decline ===\nAST's fortunes shrunk due to the strategy of offering premium models in an increasingly competitive personal computer market, while Compaq Computer Corporation and other top-tier manufacturers slashed prices to go head-to-head with the cheapest clones. The failure of AST to recognize the movement towards the commoditization of the PC contributed to its downturn.  AST insisted on developing and using its own components in the PCs it produced, instead of those of specialized OEMs. One often used saying at AST, in an attempt to dismiss such competitors, was \"

"State_Supplementation_Program| Government aid programs| Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program| ","The State Supplement Program (SSP or SSI/SSP), not to be confused with SNAP, is the state supplement to the U.S. federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program and provides state funded supplement benefits to SSI recipients.This program aims at providing a complementary financial support to individuals and couples who are elderly (usually 65 years of age and older), legally blind, or partially or fully disabled. The financial support can be considered as a global support, as it is not tied to any kind of expense. It can be used in a variety of ways, from housekeeping once in a while to daily residential care for individuals for who certain everyday tasks are difficult or impossible to do by themselves.However, very few states apply the exact same criteria of eligibility as the federal ones. The states who do let the Social Security Administration manage their SSP (see section Apply for the State Supplement Program). \nExcept from the states of Arizona, Mississippi, North Dakota, Northern Mariana Islands, and West Virginia; every state currently offers a state supplement to the federal SSI through the State Supplement Program. The conditions of eligibility to the supplement and the amount vary between the different states. The amount of the SSP ranges from $10 to $400 depending on the state. In 2020, the maximum amount of the SSI is $783 per month for an eligible individual, and $1175 for an eligible couple.\n\n\n== Usual State Supplementation Program eligibility criteria ==\nSSP eligibility criteria vary between states but we can identify the following as being the most commun:\n\nGrandfathered SSI recipients;\nIndividuals with an ineligible spouse;\nSSI recipients who are over age 65;\nSSI recipients who are blind or disabled;\nIndividuals determined eligible for SSP by the Developmental Disabilities Administration; or;\nCertain individuals who are eligible for SSI and are in foster care \n\n\n== State Supplementation Program amount variation factors ==\nThe amount paid to an eligible person will be calculated based on the following factors:\n\nliving arrangements,\nincome; and\ncounty of residenceThese primary factors serve as a base to determine individual needs. The states who administer the SSP themselves may use additional factors to determine the amount which will be paid.\n\n\n== Apply for the State Supplement Program ==\nThe application for the SSP has to be done to the state directly.\nIn some states however, no application is necessary as the state supplement is administered by the Social Security Administration. The Social Security Administration will determine the eligibility of the citizens in these states and pay the SSP along with the SSI. The states for which the SSP is administered by the Social Security Administration are the following: California, Hawaii, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, and Vermont.\nIn these states, only one payment is made to include both the SSI and the SSP, combining federal and state benefits.\nIn some states, SSP is dually administrated. Social Security administers some categories of State supplement payments, while the State administers other categories of supplemental payments. The states with a dual administration of the SSP are Delaware, District of Columbia, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. It is therefore necessary to check with the state if is eligible to the SSP under the federal or state criterions.\n\n\n== Amount of the benefits when the State Supplement Program is partially or fully administered by the Social Security Administration in 2020 ==\n\n\n== End of the benefits of the State Supplement Program ==\nA person will benefit from the State Supplement Program for as long as they fit the eligibility criterions set by the state. The payments will automatically stop if they do not fit the criterions anymore. Furthermore, any change in a person\u2019s living arrangements must be reported to the authority issuing the payments and can lead to an adjustment of the amount paid to the person. \nShould a person not be eligible to receive the SSI anymore, they will not be a part of the SSP as well as the SSP is a complementary program to the federal Supplementary Security Income program.\n\n\n== Specificities by state (non exhaustive list) ==\n\n\n=== Massachusetts ===\nIt is possible not be to eligible for SSI but to be eligible for Massachusetts\u2019 SSP. That is because the maximum income to be eligible for SSP in Massachusetts is higher than the one set for the federal SSI.\nHowever, in order to apply for the SSP, it is needed to apply for SSI first even a person is not eligible for the SSI but only for the SSP.\nBenefits are paid at the beginning of each month.\n\n\n=== New Hampshire ===\nEligibility criteria in New Hampshire are the following:\n\nbeing a resident of 65 years of age or older;\nbeing a resident between the ages of 18 and 64, and is determined by the State to be physically or mentally disabled, partially or fully; and\nbeing a resident of any age who is determined by the State to be legally blind.\n\n\n== References =="

Her research makes use of remote sensing technology to understand the characteristics of plant communities.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nUstin is from Eugene, Oregon. After graduating from high school in 1961, Ustin moved to San Francisco with her friends. She was inspired by the city's activism, in particular the civil rights movement and environmental advocates. She first studied biology at California State University, East Bay, specialising in plant physiological ecology. She remained there for a master's degree, before moving to the University of California, Davis for her doctoral degree. Alongside her doctoral research Ustin started working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. She started working on remote sensing technology in the early 1980s, when the field was then in its infancy.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nHer work considers remote sensing of environmental and landscape properties, making use of hyperspectral analysis and thermal scanners. Remote sensing has since been used to monitor natural disasters, study climate changes and monitor air pollution. Over the course of her career, Ustin made use of remote sensing data from five different continents, including tracking the impacts of agriculture on forests and monitoring invasive plant species.Ustin held several positions at University of California, Davis, including serving as Director of both the Center for Spatial Technology and Remote Sensing and the John Muir Institute of the Environment. She worked with NASA to build space-based imaging spectrometers.\nIn 2020 Ustin was elected to the Ecological Society of America. Her citation read, \u201cElected for research pioneering the use of remote sensing technology for detecting changes in plant community characteristics, biological diversity, and land use, and for her continued influence on the field,\u201d.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2010 Honorary Doctorate from the University of Zurich\n2017 Elected Fellow of the American Geophysical Union\n2020 Elected Fellow of the Ecological Society of America\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nRoberts, D.A.; Gardner, M.; Church, R.; Ustin, S.; Scheer, G.; Green, R.O.

"Holcomb_Valley| Mining in California| Valleys of San Bernardino County, California| San Bernardino Mountains| Gold mining| American gold rushes| Valleys of California| ","Holcomb Valley, located in the San Bernardino Mountains about five miles north of Big Bear Lake, was the site of the most gold mines in Southern California. It was named after William F. Holcomb, who found gold there in 1860. That year started the largest gold rush in the Southern California region.  The boomtown of Belleville grew up near there and flourished for about ten years before being abandoned. The site is now registered as California Historical Landmark #619.\n\n\n== Gold ==\nIn May 1860, gold was found there by William F. Holcomb and Ben Choteau.  They were miners who had been prospecting at Bear Valley. Holcomb found gold while he was tracking a bear in the valley later named after him. After Holcomb and Ben Ware filed mine claims on five sites in May 1860 at the County Recorder's office, word spread quickly and prospectors rushed to the area.Before long, a gold camp sprang up within 150 inches of where the gold was found. It became a town and, after the first child Belle was born, the new town was named Belleville in her honor. It soon became the largest town in San Bernardino County with a population of about 1,500. \nOften perpetuated by local newsmen, is the myth that Belleville was almost once the County seat. The story goes that Belleville residents felt they deserved the honor of being the county seat and placed this measure on the ballot in either 1860 or 1861. After the election, ballots were being counted at the County Court House (in San Bernardino City) around an open bonfire when one of the ballot boxes, allegedly from Belleville, was accidentally, kicked into the fire and destroyed. When the count was completed, Belleville had lost the county seat election by the slim margin of two votes. \nHowever, the California Constitution allows for a change in county seat only through legislative action in which it may directly decide the location, or delegate the authority to the voters of the county, which would require it to be placed on the local ballot. There was no legislative act on record in State Records to change the county seat from San Bernardino to Belleville, in any year, let alone 1860 or 1861. Any item up for election on the local ballot was required to be posted in the local newspaper. The only items published in both 1860 and 1861 were the names of the people running for office and school bonds. The items up for election are also required to be listed in the Board of Supervisor minutes, there is no such listing for the change of the County seat. Also there is no mention of the election or missing ballots in Holcomb's recollections which were written in the 1870s only a few years later at the behest of the San Bernardino Pioneer Society. \nBelleville was a place filled with rough characters competing over gold, it was considered a place of violence and hanging justice. It was the third and fourth largest town in Southern California during these yearsHolcomb Valley produced the most wealth from gold of any Southern California mining district. With time, major placer and quartz mining declined, followed by the departure of most of the population of Belleville after 1870. Hard rock mining continued at the Gold Mountain Mine until 1919.  Some mining activity continues today, with 2,000 claims by hobbyists.The valley is the site of the Holcomb Valley Scout Ranch (formerly of Old Baldy Council), on the site of the old Hitchcock Ranch. It provides opportunities for youth to have experience in ranching, hiking and related outdoor activities.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCalifornia Gold Rush\nThe Night of the Grizzly\nCalifornia Historical Landmarks in San Bernardino County, California\n\n\n== References =="

"City_Art_Centre| Art museums and galleries in Edinburgh| ","The City Art Centre is part of the Museums & Galleries Edinburgh, which sits under the Culture directorate of the City of Edinburgh Council. The City Art Centre has a collection which include historic and modern Scottish painting and photography, as well as contemporary art and craft. It is an exhibition based venue with no permanent displays.\nThe City Art Centre is home to the City of Edinburgh's Recognised collection of Scottish Art. Edinburgh's fine art collection is approximately 4,800 pieces of Scottish work in a variety of mediums. Artists such Fergusson, Eardley, Paolozzi are represented in the collection as well as many other Edinburgh based and Scottish artists. Artists are represented dating from the 17th century to the present day.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1971 the City Art Centre was housed in the former Royal High School. In 1975 the reform of the Scottish local government brought the City Museums and the City Art Centre together the new council directorate of the Recreation Department. The City Art Centre was then rehoused to its current Market Street location in 1980.The current City Art Centre building dates  from 1899 to 1902  and was the work of  Dunn and Findlay. Built as an extension to the Scotsman newspaper office, it later became part of the city\u2019s wholesale fruit and vegetable market.\nDesigned as a nine storey iron-framed warehouse, it is clad in stone to create a restrained Beaux Arts facade. It has public galleries on 6 floors.\nThe original conversion of the building in 1980 was undertaken by the City Architect's Department under the direction of the then City Architect, Brian Annable, and it garnered a RIBA Award for Architecture in 1983. In the 1990s more  space was created by extending into  the upper floors. Natural materials and neutral colours are used  throughout the interior to create flexible contemporary exhibition spaces.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\nIn 1961 Miss Jean Watson, an Edinburgh resident, at first gave and then later bequeathed money to create a collection of Scottish Art for the City of Edinburgh. The fund is administered by the City Council and is still in use today. Soon after Miss Watson gave her initial sum of money, a Committee was formed to administer the funds. One of their first decisions was to commission a bronze bust of Miss Watson herself from a sculptor, Eric Schilsky. From the outset, the Committee opted to purchase contemporary works of art by Scottish artists or artists based in Scotland. One of their first purchases was Obsession by John Bellany. Since then, more than 900 paintings, drawings, sculpture, photographs and prints have been added.  Works by contemporary artists such as Moyna Flannigan, Calum Colvin, Peter Howson and Dame Elizabeth Blackadder have all been acquired with Bequest Funds.In 1964 more than 300 of the works owned by the Scottish Modern Arts Association were donated to the City of Edinburgh during the dissolution of the Scottish Modern Arts Association. These are now housed in the City Art Centre.\nThe Scottish Arts Council began collecting in 1951, with a focus on the purchase of artworks by contemporary Scottish based artists. In the mid 1990s the Scottish Arts Council took the decision to distribute its collection of approximately 2,000 works by contemporary Scottish artists to museums and galleries throughout Scotland. Institutions were given the opportunity to view the collection and submit proposals for acquisition, the City Art Centre applied and in 1998 received 123 works of art.Through the National Collecting Scheme for Scotland, six major museums and art galleries, including the City Art Centre, have been able to acquire new works by contemporary artists. The Scheme has been in operation since 2003, and was established to assist museums and galleries throughout Scotland purchase work by contemporary artists and craft makers. To avoid duplication, each member gallery is invited to collect within a broad theme. In recognition of Edinburgh\u2019s World Heritage Site Status, the City Art Centre is acquiring works all of which have an urban or architectural theme. Since the scheme began, the City Art Centre have acquired a variety of work including film, photography and installation. Artists now represented include Toby Paterson, Christine Borland, Graham Fagen, Rosalind Nashashibi, Nathan Coley and Rose Frain.\nIn collaboration with Edinburgh Libraries, the Museums & Galleries Edinburgh show their collection on Capital Collections. Capital Collections is an image library which allows a selection of collections to be viewed.\n\n\n== References =="

"Toggenburg| Toggenburg| ","Toggenburg is a region of Switzerland. It corresponds to the upper valley of the river Thur and that of its main tributary, the Necker. Since 1 January 2003, Toggenburg has been a constituency (Wahlkreis) of the canton of St. Gallen (SFOS number 1727).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe valley descends in a northwestern direction from the watershed between the Rhine and the Thur, and is enclosed on the northeast by the chain of the S\u00e4ntis (8,216 ft [2,504 m]) and on the southwest by that of the Churfirsten (7,566 ft [2,306 m]) and of the Speer (6,411 ft [1,954 m]). It is a fertile valley of about 45 kilometres (28 mi) in length from the source of the river to Wil.At Wildhaus, the highest village (3,632 ft [1,107 m]), the house wherein Huldrych Zwingli, the Swiss Reformer, was born in 1484, is still shown. Other villages are Lichtensteig, Kirchberg and Wattwil.\n\n\n== History ==\nThere are traces of the paleolithic Mousterian Industry throughout the Appenzell Alps, in the Toggenburg notably in Wildenmannlisloch cave.\nThe upper Thur valley was part of the province of Raetia in the Roman era, and was reached by Alemannic-speaking settlers only in the early medieval period. This is evidenced by a substantial substrate of Romance toponyms in the upper Toggenburg (upstream of Stein).The name of the region is derived from that of the House of Toggenburg (named for their castle near Kirchberg) who ruled over parts of the Toggenburg region since the 12th century, in the 13th century taking the title of counts (comes) and extending their domain to include all of the upper Thur valley.\nThe extinction of the main line of the counts of Toggenburg  (1436) led to the Old Z\u00fcrich War (1440\u201346) ultimately resulting in the temporary expulsion of Z\u00fcrich from the Swiss confederacy. Eventually, the Toggenburg passed to the lord of Raron (in Valais), who sold it to the abbot of St. Gall in 1468.Part of the Toggenburg followed the Swiss Reformation led by Zwingli, and the valley declared itself independent in 1530, but was forced to re-submit to the Abbot of St. Gall in 1538. The Abbot was, however, pressured into toleration of either confession, so that the Toggenburg became one of the few regions of Switzerland where Catholicism and Protestantism have a tradition of co-existence.\nIn 1707, the Toggenburg again declared its independence of St. Gall, in reaction to the Abbey's plans to build a road across the Ricken Pass, which was seen as a strategic arrangement towards a Catholic military alliance. The ensuing Toggenburg war of 1712 resulted in a balance of power between Catholic and Protestant cantons, ultimately leading to the formation of Switzerland as a federal state.\nIn the Helvetic Republic, the Toggenburg was divided between the cantons of S\u00e4ntis and Linth. The parts were re-united as part of the canton of St. Gallen in 1803.\nSch\u00fcblig, a type of sausage is a tradition in the area.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe Toggenburg Wahlkreis has a population of 46,954 (as of 31 December 2020).

"Pueraria_montana| Pueraria| Taxa named by João de Loureiro| ","Pueraria montana is a species of plant in the botanical family Fabaceae. At least three sub-species (alternatively called varieties) are known. It is closely related to other species in the genus Pueraria (P. edulis and P. phaseoloides) and the common name kudzu is used for all of these species and hybrids between them. The morphological differences between them are subtle, they can breed with each other, and it appears that introduced kudzu populations in the United States have ancestry from more than one of the species.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIt is a seasonal climbing plant, growing high where suitable surfaces (trees, cliffs, walls) are available, and also growing as ground cover where there are no vertical surfaces. It is a perennial vine with tuberous roots and rope-like, dark brown stems to 20 m (65 ft) long. It grows up to 20 metres per year and can achieve a height of 30 metres. It has markedly hairy herbaceous stems.\nPueraria montana is native to East Asia, primarily subtropical and temperate regions of China, Japan, and Korea, with trifoliate leaves composed of three leaflets. Each leaflet is large and ovate with two to three lobes each and hair on the underside. The species can fix atmospheric nitrogen, which can supply up to 95% of leaf nitrogen to the plant in poor soils. Along the vines are nodes, points at which stems or tendrils can propagate to increase support and attach to structures. As a twining vine, kudzu uses stems or tendrils that can extend from any node on the vine to attach to and climb most surfaces. In addition, the nodes of the kudzu vine have the ability to root when exposed to soil, further anchoring the vine to the ground. The roots are tuberous and are high in starch and water content, and the twining of the plant allows for less carbon concentration in the construction of woody stems and greater concentration in roots, which aids root growth. The roots can account for up to 40% of total plant biomass.\n Flowers are reddish-purple and yellow, fragrant, similar to pea flowers, about 20\u201325 millimetres (0.79\u20130.98 in) wide and are produced at the leaf axis in elongated racemes about 20 centimetres (7.9 in) long. The flowering period extends from July through October. The fruit is a flat hairy pod about 8 centimetres (3.1 in) long with three seeds.\nKudzu's primary method of reproduction is asexual vegetative spread (cloning) which is aided by the ability to root wherever a stem is exposed to soil. For sexual reproduction, kudzu is entirely dependent on pollinators.Although kudzu prefers forest regrowth and edge habitats with high sun exposure, the plant can survive in full sun or partial shade. These attributes of kudzu made it attractive as an ornamental plant for shading porches in the Southeastern United States, but they facilitated the growth of kudzu as it became a \u201cstructural parasite\u201d of the southern states, enveloping entire structures when untreated and often referred to as \u201cthe vine that ate the south\u201d.\n\n\n== Subspecies and varieties ==\nPueraria montana var. chinensis (Ohwi) Sanjappa & Pradeep\nPueraria montana var. lobata (Willd.) Sanjappa & Pradeep\nPueraria montana var. thomsonii (Benth.) Wiersema ex D.B. Ward\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe Latin specific epithet montana refers to mountains or coming from mountains.\n\n\n== Invasive species ==\n\nThe natural range of Pueraria montana can be found in India, Myanmar, Indochina, China, Korea, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, the Pacific Islands, and in north Australia. In its native habitat, it and its closely related species occur across wide areas; the species have diverged genetically due to vicariance. Its invasiveness can be attributed to similarities between both native and newly invaded niches, effectively expanding its habitable range into areas with climates it may not be able to endure otherwise.Like other exotic species, the introduction to other areas is due to human actions. Seeds are spread by mammals and birds. Kudzu are plants adapted to drought. Only above ground portions are damaged by frost; thick storage roots grow as deep as 1 metre. It forms new perennial root crowns from stem nodes touching the ground.\nThe ecological requirements of the species are those of the subtropical and temperate habitat areas.In Europe, Pueraria montana grows in several places in the warm regions of Switzerland and Italy near Lake Maggiore and Lake Lugano.\nDuring World War II, kudzu was introduced to Vanuatu and Fiji by United States Armed Forces to serve as camouflage for equipment. It is now a major weed there.Pueraria montana is also becoming a problem in Queensland.\nIn the United States, Pueraria montana is extensively reported in the coastal states from eastern Texas to Florida, North to Maryland, as well as inland in Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Washington, D.C., and West Virginia. Since 2004, Kudzu has moved farther North along the Ohio River, appearing in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. Of all affected states, three in the southeast have the heaviest infestations: Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.\n\n\n== Effects on biodiversity ==\n\nDue to the aggressive, climbing nature of P. montana it often causes shading and death of native vegetation, resulting in a monoculture of P. montana. As P. montana spreads, it shades and crushes its competitors with its weight, eliminating everything in its path. As a result of growing over native plants and trees, it blocks their access of vital resources such as sunlight, killing off young vegetation. These result in dramatic reductions in native biodiversity at the local level.Other than the loss of biodiversity of plant species, P. montana may have a negative effect on animals. Many plant species that are suppressed by P. montana because of its uncontrolled and rapid growth negatively impacts some wildlife animals that have specific mutualisms or feeding relationships with these plant species. This potentially could lead to the death of certain animal species, specifically herbivores, that depend on some vegetation as a resource for both food and shelter. These are important factors that lead to habitat destruction and reduction in animal biodiversity.\n\n\n== Impacts of global changes ==\nChanges in the global environment such as higher CO2 levels, higher temperatures, greater rates of nitrogen deposition, and greater fragmentation of natural habitats are predicted to increase the spread of P. montana.\n\n\n=== Carbon dioxide ===\nKudzu is highly responsive to increased CO2 levels as it results in maximal leaf expansion, increase in leaf size, and an overall 12% increase in leaf production.  In turn, the plant has higher turgor pressure which results in the improvements in its growth potential. As the atmospheric CO2 concentration continues to rise, it is possible for the potential enhancement of P. montana\u2019s invasiveness.\n\n\n=== Temperature ===\nWith global warming, overnight temperatures tend to increase. Data collected in the United States over the past few decades showed a reduction in frost days, an earlier date for the last freeze in spring, and a later date for the first freeze in fall. These favour the spread of  P. montana.  \nThe northward distribution of P. montana is hypothesized to be limited by low temperatures. Cold temperatures cause their leaves to be killed off and their leaf expansion to be lagged. However, with the continuous rise in global temperature, it is predicted that P. montana will rapidly spread northward as a result of the increased number of warmer days.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nL.

The A350 follows a lower route through villages in the Blackmore Vale.  However, much traffic uses the hilltop route as an alternative because it is straighter and passes through fewer villages. Melbury Abbas is the only bottleneck on this road, where it dips down into the valley and becomes narrower. \nDorset County Council have considered bypass schemes, but none has got further than preliminary because Melbury Abbas village is surrounded by conservation land.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Melbury Abbas at Wikimedia Commons"

"Leaf_curl| Fungal tree pathogens and diseases| Viral plant pathogens and diseases| Stone fruit tree diseases| Leaf diseases| ","Peach leaf curl is a plant disease characterized by distortion and coloration of leaves and is caused by the fungus Taphrina deformans, which infects peach, nectarine, and almond trees.  T. deformans is found in the United States, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Peach leaf curl reduces the amount of leaves and fruit produced by peach and nectarine trees.\n\n\n== Affected species ==\nPeach leaf curl mainly affects peach, nectarine, and almond trees. Apricots are generally immune to peach leaf curl (instead, the major apricot diseases are blossom wilt and branch dieback caused by Monilinia fructicola in the spring and Eutypa lata in the summer). However, in an isolated case in Hungary in 2011, peach leaf curl was also identified in apricot trees.\n\n\n== Symptoms ==\nPeach leaf curl is a distinctive and easily noticeable fungal disease, and the severity of the symptoms depends on how early infection has occurred. Diseased leaves can usually be identified soon after they emerge from the bud, due to their red color and twisted shape. As the leaves develop, they become increasingly distorted, and ultimately thick and rubbery compared to normal leaves. The color of the leaves changes from the normal green to red and purple, until a whitish bloom covers each leaf. Finally, the dead leaf may dry and turn black before it is cast off. Changes in the bark are less noticeable, if at all. Fruit may fail to develop from diseased blossoms. Any fruit that does develop from a diseased tree is usually normal, but sometimes may also be affected, showing a reddish color.  Infected leaves fall early. The tree usually produces a second flush of leaves that is rarely diseased, except in an unseasonably cool and wet spring, because the fungus is not infectious at the normally higher temperatures in late spring and early summer.\n\n\n== Cause of peach leaf curl ==\nThe fungus T. deformans causes deformed young leaves, red blisters, and ultimately the whitish bloom that covers the leaf as the infection progresses. This white color is made of asci that break through the cuticle of the leaf. One ascus consists of eight ascospores that create conidia, which are ejected in early summer and spread by rain and wind. The fungus survives the winter on the surface of the host plant, such as on bark or buds. In late winter or early spring, rainwater washes spores into the buds as they burst. Once this happens, no treatment is effective. In the spring, about two weeks after blossom, new leaves emerging from the infected buds are infected by the conidia. The disease may not occur every year due to variation in temperature and rainfall. Specifically, for successful infection, the fungus requires wet winters, where rain (not fog or dew) wets the tree for more than 12.5 hours at temperatures below 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F). The fungus cannot grow at temperatures below 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Control of the disease ==\nVarious methods are applied.\n\nThe most effective method is to plant peach trees against a house wall under an overhanging roof, possibly covered by a mat during the winter, to keep winter rain from the buds before they burst (and incidentally to delay blossoming until spring frosts are over), until the temperature exceeds 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in the spring, deactivating the fungus.\nCommercially, spraying the leaves with fungicides is the most common control method. The toxicity of these fungicides means they are not legally available to noncommercial growers in some countries. Spraying should be done in the winter well before budding. If trees are not sprayed early enough, treatment is ineffective. Copper-based mixtures (such as Bordeaux mixture) and lime sulphur are two fungicides commonly used.\nPeach cultivars can be planted which show some resistance to peach leaf curl, or at least regenerate rapidly, such as the white-fleshed Peach 'Benedicte'. For nectarines, the cultivar Kreibich is reported to have some resistance.If a tree has peach leaf curl in a particular year, the disease will inexorably take its course, but measures can be taken to sustain the tree or maximize crop yield: protecting the tree from further rain at temperatures below 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F), applying greasebands around the trunk to protect from insect infestation spreading the disease; providing nitrogen and excess water to minimize stress on the tree; and thinning the fruit. It is unclear whether removal of infected leaves from the tree is beneficial. Removing the infected leaves and fruit after they fall to the ground is sometimes also suggested but superfluous if, in the following winter, fungicides or rain protection are applied.\n\n\n== History ==\nPeach leaf curl was first introduced in America in 1852 and has now spread all over the country. By 1947, the disease was costing the United States $2.5 to 3.0 million annually.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIndex Fungorum\nUSDA ARS Fungal Database\nRoyal Horticultural Society - Peach Leaf Curl\nTreatment of peach leaf curl"

"Ordinariate_for_the_Faithful_of_Eastern_Rite_in_Spain| Ordinariates for Eastern Catholic faithful| Eastern Catholicism in Spain| Catholic Church in Spain| Roman Catholic dioceses in Spain| Eastern Catholic dioceses| Eastern Catholic dioceses in Europe| ","The Ordinariate for the Faithful of Eastern Rite in Spain is an Ordinariate (pseudo-diocese) for all non-Latin Catholic faithful living in Spain who belong to the particular Churches sui iuris of any Eastern rite immediately subject to the Holy See.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was erected on 9 June 2016 by Pope Francis, who also named the current Archbishop of Madrid, Carlos Osoro Sierra, as its first Ordinary.Its creation was a response to the increase of Eastern Catholics in Spanish territory, until then spiritually assisted by the various local dioceses. The Spanish Episcopal Conference already had a pastoral care department for the faithful of oriental rites, who in 2003 drew up the document Orientations for the pastoral care of Eastern Catholics in Spain.The Ordinariate has jurisdiction over all the Catholic faithful of the Eastern rite who live in Spain and may appoint vicars general, having appointed the presbyter Andr\u00e9s Mart\u00ednez Esteban for that position. Like the Ordinariate for Eastern Catholics in France, the ordinary has a personal jurisdiction over the Eastern faithful that is cumulative with the diocesan bishops, from whom he must obtain consent for the decisions that pertain to their respective dioceses, and that retain secondary jurisdiction in minor matters (unlike other oriental ordinariates in what the ordinary has full jurisdiction). It must also require the consent of the primate and synods of the Eastern Churches in the decisions that involve them and obtain from them the clergy of the Ordinariate.Between May 2 and 4, 2017 the ordinary met with the priests of the 3 oriental rites present in Spain to advance in the constitution of the Ordinariate.\n\n\n== Territory ==\nThe Ordinariate has jurisdiction over the Catholic faithful of all Eastern rites living in Spain. Its seat is the city of Madrid.\n\n\n=== Eastern Catholic communities in Spain ===\nEastern Catholics in Spain are mainly from the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church and from the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, both of Byzantine rite. There are also communities of the Syro Malabar Catholic Church. A small Coptic Catholic community that existed in Spain no longer existed at the time of the erection of the Ordinariate, as its faithful migrated to other European countries.\n\n\n==== Romanian Greek-Catholic Church ====\nOn March 16, 2009 the Cardinal and Archbishop of Madrid Antonio Maria Rouco Varela appointed the priest Bogdan Vasile Buda as chaplain responsible for the Romanian community of Byzantine rite residing in the archdiocese of Madrid. In April 2009 he assigned a chapel of the parish of Our Lady of Sorrows in Madrid for the pastoral care of the Romanian faithful of the Byzantine rite of his archdiocese. The community is called Capelania Greco-Catolic\u0103 din Madrid Botezul Domnului (Baptism of the Lord). On March 1, 2012 Bogdan Vasile Buda was named archpriest (protopop) by the Cardinal Primate of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, Lucian Mure\u015fan, and by the archiepiscopal major synod, becoming the national leader of the Romanian Greek Catholic faithful and priests of Spain (Greco-Romanian Catholic Deanery (arciprestazgo) of Madrid).The archpriest has 8 priests serving two parishes and 6 chaplaincies:\nDiocese of Orihuela-Alicante: the chaplaincy is in the church of San Roque in Alicante, with masses once a month in the church of San Pedro and San Pablo de Torrevieja\nDiocese of Almer\u00eda: chaplaincy in the church of the Holy Family of Almer\u00eda (Sf\u00e2nta Familie)\nDiocese of Ciudad Real: in the church of the Remedios of Ciudad Real\nArchdiocese of Granada: existing since 2006, the priest serves in the communities of Castell de Ferro (parish church Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen), Motril (in the church of Carmen) and Granada (in the Virgen del Carmen church, which has a pastoral with gypsies)\nDiocese of Mallorca: a community in the Oratory of San Telm in Palma de Mallorca\n\nDiocese of Calahorra and La Calzada-Logro\u00f1o: Romanian Greek Catholic parish of San Nicol\u00e1s in Calahorra (Parohia Greco-Catolic\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103 Sf\u00e2ntul Nicolae)\nDiocese of Le\u00f3n: the Romanian Greek Catholic parish of Le\u00f3n (Pogor\u00e2rea Sf\u00e2ntului Spirit, in the church of the Railway Orphans of Le\u00f3n and in the chapel of Caritas Diocesana de Benavente).Minor communities without a resident priest exist in the dioceses of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Getafe and Zamora.\n\n\n==== Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church ====\nUkrainian Greek Catholic communities have two parishes (Barcelona and Huelva) and 23 priests in 14 Spanish dioceses:\nDiocese of Albacete\nDiocese of Almer\u00eda: community of Campohermoso\nArchdiocese of Barcelona: personal parish of Sant Josep, Santa M\u00f2nica and Sant Josafat\nDiocese of C\u00e1diz and Ceuta\nDiocese of Cartagena: community of Murcia\nDiocese of C\u00f3rdoba\nDiocese of Cuenca\nDiocese of Gerona\nArchdiocese of Granada: in the parish of Santo \u00c1ngel Custodio\nDiocese of Huelva: have since 2015 in the parish of Saints Cyril and Methodius its own temple on which depends the community of Seville (also with its own temple, the church of the Sisters of Mary Repairing)\nDiocese of Lleida\nArchdiocese of Madrid: Ukrainian chaplaincy with headquarters in the parish of Our Lady of Good Success with 2000 parishioners, on which the chaplaincies depend in the parishes of Santa Teresa de Jesus de Getafe and Virgen de Bel\u00e9n de Alcal\u00e1 de Henares\nDiocese of M\u00e1laga\nDiocese of Mallorca: Ukrainian chaplaincy in the church of Santa Fe in Palma de Mallorca\nDiocese of Orihuela-Alicante: community in Torrevieja\nArchdiocese of Pamplona\nDiocese of Solsona\nArchdiocese of Tarragona\nDiocese of Urgell\nArchdiocese of Valencia\nDiocese of Vic: communities in Torell\u00f3 and in Vic\nDiocese of Vitoria\nArchdiocese of ZaragozaBishop Hlib Lonchyna was apostolic visitor for Ukrainian Greek Catholics in Spain from March 4, 2004 until January 7, 2009. He was succeeded since January 19, 2009 by the titular bishop of Egnazia, Dionisio Lachovicz, as apostolic visitor in Italy and Spain, appointed by Pope Benedict XVI and based in Rome. In 2009 it was estimated that in Spain there were 42,000 faithful in 45 communities of Ukrainians of Byzantine rite, attended by 17 priests.\n\n\n==== Syro-Malabar Catholic Church ====\nIn Madrid there is the Syro Malabar community of Saint Thomas, with 80 members and a priest since 2009, and four other communities in Barcelona, Granada, Toledo and Valladolid, which together another 120 worshipers, ten priests and four nuns.\n\n\n== Ordinaries ==\nCarlos Osoro Sierra (since 2016.06.09)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGcatholic.org\nCatholic-hierarchy"

He was the uncle of Rasse of Gavre, 1st Marquess of Ayseau.\nIn 1601 he received from Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor the hereditary title of Prince de Ligne.\nAs a diplomat, the first Prince de Ligne was involved in many historic events of his time. He represented Archduke Albert of Austria and Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain at the French court of Henri IV of France, in Spain and again in Paris, to congratulate King Louis XIII of France with his marriage with the daughter of Philip III of Spain. During this mission, he discussed several issues with the French political leaders.\nIn 1621 Prince Lamoral I was made grandee of Spain by King Philip IV of Spain for his services rendered to the Crown.

"Festucalex_cinctus| IUCN Red List least concern species| Festucalex| Marine fish| Fish described in 1882| ","Festucalex cinctus (girdled pipefish or orange-cheek pipefish) is a species of marine fish of the pipefish family Syngnathidae which is endemic to the waters off eastern Australia.\n\n\n== Identifying features ==\nThis species can be recognized by its broad head, slender snout, and leafy appendages on its dorsal ridges. Its colour varies from dark grey to orange-brown with pale bars along the back and an orange blotch on the lower gill cover, with occasional sightings of pale or black individuals. It can grow to lengths of 16 centimetres (6.3 in).\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nFestucalex cinctus is endemic to Australia, found off the coast of Queensland and New South Wales. It is a secretive species which lives in sheltered coastal bays and estuaries, on patches of coral rubble, sand or in areas where there is a sparse growth of seagrass, algae and sponges, at depths of 8\u201331 metres (26\u2013102 ft). F. cinctus has been recorded in small numbers in the open water near to pilings of piers in harbours.\n\n\n== Biology ==\nFestucalex cinctus is demersal and is expected to feed on small crustaceans, similar to other pipefish. This species is ovoviviparous, with males carrying eggs and giving birth to live young. The males bear the fertilised eggs in a semi-enclosed pouch on the ventral side of the trunk, this pouch has distinct protective plates and its folds barely meet on the midline when it is full of eggs.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nFestucalex cinctus is a species of marine animal listed under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and which is protected under the New South Wales Fisheries Management Act. Specimens from the tropical part of its distribution, in northern Queensland and the Northern Territory, appear to be different from specimens in New South Wales and may represent a different species.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nFishes of Australia\nGovernment of Australia Department of the Environment and Energy"

"Paint| Paints| Painting materials| Coatings| ","Paint is any pigmented liquid, liquefiable, or solid mastic composition that, after application to a substrate in a thin layer, converts to a solid film. It is most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture. Paint can be made or purchased in many colors\u2014and in many different types. Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but most types dry into a solid. Most paints are either oil-based or water-based and each has distinct characteristics. For one, it is illegal in most municipalities to discard oil-based paint down household drains or sewers. Clean-up solvents are also different for water-based paint than they are for oil-based paint. Water-based paints and oil-based paints will cure differently based on the outside ambient temperature of the object being painted (such as a house.) Usually, the object being painted must be over 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F), although some manufacturers of external paints/primers claim they can be applied when temperatures are as low as 2 \u00b0C (35 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPaint was one of the earliest arts of humanity. Some cave paintings drawn with red or yellow ochre, hematite, manganese oxide, and charcoal may have been made by early Homo sapiens as long as 40,000 years ago. Paint may be even older. In 2003 and 2004, South African archeologists reported finds in Blombos Cave of a 100,000-year-old human-made ochre-based mixture that could have been used like paint. Further excavation in the same cave resulted in the 2011 report of a complete toolkit for grinding pigments and making a primitive paint-like substance.Interior walls at the 5,000-year-old Ness of Brodgar have been found to incorporate individual stones painted in yellows, reds, and oranges, using ochre pigment made of haematite mixed with animal fat, milk or eggs.Ancient colored walls at Dendera, Egypt, which were exposed for years to the elements, still possess their brilliant color, as vivid as when they were painted about 2,000 years ago. The Egyptians mixed their colors with a gummy substance and applied them separately from each other without any blending or mixture. They appear to have used six colors: white, black, blue, red, yellow, and green. They first covered the area entirely with white, then traced the design in black, leaving out the lights of the ground color. They used minium for red, generally of a dark tinge.\nThe oldest known oil paintings are Buddhist murals created circa 650 AD. The works are located in cave-like rooms carved from the cliffs of Afghanistan's Bamiyan Valley, \"

His widespread activity in the region made him an influential figure in New England and Boston classical music, especially choral music, in the latter half of the 19th century. He was especially successful in the presentation of the great oratorios and the management of large choruses.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe began the study of music in Rostock at the age of twelve years, and completed his education in Hanover and Berlin. The revolutions of 1848 motivated him to leave Europe, and with 25 others he organized The Germania Musical Society and went to the United States, giving concerts in London on the way. Zerrahn played first flute. The group reached New York City in September 1848 and gave successful concerts in New York and Brooklyn which were followed by others in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, and New England. They appeared for five or six years with Jenny Lind, Henriette Sontag, Ole Bull, Sigismund Thalberg, Alfred Ja\u00ebll, Camilla Urso, and other artists, disbanding in 1854 after giving 800 concerts during its career.\n\nZerrahn settled in Boston at the conclusion of the tour. From 1855 until 1863 he conducted a Boston \u201cPhilharmonic,\u201d one of several orchestras going by that name at that time.  Beginning in 1865, he led concerts for the Harvard Musical Association until the concerts were discontinued in 1882.  He conducted the Handel and Haydn Society 1854-1895, and he directed the Worcester Music Festival in Massachusetts for thirty years as well, 1866-1897. He was elected conductor of the Oratorio Society of Salem, Massachusetts in 1868, and conducted choral societies in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, Ogdensburg, New York, and other places.\nHe directed the choral forces for Patrick Gilmore's  National Peace Jubilee of 1869 and the World's Peace Jubilee and International Musical Festival of 1872. In 1869, this amounted to a chorus of 10,000; in 1872 the chorus was twice that size though in the latter case the results were not entirely satisfactory. He taught singing, harmony and composition at the New England Conservatory of Music until 1898, when he retired.Among the journals he edited were The Index, The Apograph, The Atlas, and Carl Zerrahn's Selections.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nHoward, John Tasker (1939).

"Hemicontinuity| Mathematical analysis| Continuous mappings| Variational analysis| ","In mathematics, the notion of the continuity of functions is not immediately extensible to multivalued mappings or correspondences between two sets A and B. \nThe dual concepts of upper hemicontinuity and lower hemicontinuity facilitate such an extension. \nA correspondence that has both properties is said to be continuous in an analogy to the property of the same name for functions.\nRoughly speaking, a function is upper hemicontinuous when (1) a convergent sequence of points in the domain maps to a sequence of sets in the range which (2) contain another convergent sequence, then the image of the limiting point in the domain must contain the limit of the sequence in the range. \nLower hemicontinuity

But this should be taken with appropriate care since, for example, there exists a pair of lower hemicontinuous correspondences whose intersection is not lower hemicontinuous. \nThis can be fixed upon strengthening continuity properties: if one of those lower hemicontinuous multifunctions has open graph then their intersection is again lower hemicontinuous.\nCrucial to set-valued analysis (in view of applications) are the investigation of single-valued selections and approximations to multivalued maps. \nTypically lower hemicontinuous correspondences admit single-valued selections (Michael selection theorem, Bressan\u2013Colombo directionally continuous selection theorem, Fryszkowski decomposable map selection). \nLikewise, upper hemicontinuous maps admit approximations (e.g. Ancel\u2013Granas\u2013G\u00f3rniewicz\u2013Kryszewski theorem).\n\n\n== Implications for continuity ==\nIf a correspondence is both upper hemicontinuous and lower hemicontinuous, it is said to be continuous. \nA continuous function is in all cases both upper and lower hemicontinuous.\n\n\n== Other concepts of continuity ==\nThe upper and lower hemicontinuity might be viewed as usual continuity:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u0393\n        :\n        A\n        \u2192\n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Gamma :A\\to B}\n   is lower [resp. upper] hemicontinuous if and only if the mapping \n  \n    \n      \n        \u0393\n        :\n        A\n        \u2192\n        P\n        (\n        B\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Gamma :A\\to P(B)}\n   is continuous where the hyperspace P(B) has been endowed with the lower [resp. upper] Vietoris topology.(For the notion of hyperspace compare also power set and function space).\nUsing lower and upper Hausdorff uniformity we can also define the so-called upper and lower semicontinuous maps in the sense of Hausdorff (also known as metrically lower / upper semicontinuous maps).\n\n\n== See also ==\nDifferential inclusion\nHausdorff distance\nMultivalued function \u2013 Generalization of a function that may produce several outputs for each input\nSemicontinuity\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAliprantis, Charalambos D.; Border, Kim C.

Under the direction of Thomas M. Owen its founder, the agency received state funding by an act of the Alabama Legislature on February 27, 1901. Its primary mission is the collecting and preserving of archives, documents and artifacts relating to the history of the state.  It was the first publicly funded, independent state archives agency in the United States.  It subsequently became a model for the establishment of archives in other states.  Today the agency identifies, preserves, and makes accessible records and artifacts significant to the history of the state and serves as the official repository for records created by Alabama's state agencies.\n\n\n== The building and exhibits ==\nThe Department of Archives and History was housed in the old Senate cloak room at the Alabama State Capitol after its establishment in 1901.  It was then moved to the Capitol's new south wing upon its completion in 1906.  A separate building was first conceived of in 1918 by Thomas McAdory Owen, the first director of the Archives.  However, funding did not become available until the 1930s, when the next director, Marie Bankhead Owen (wife of Thomas), was able to secure the necessary capital from the Works Progress Administration.The three-story Neoclassical building was built from 1938\u201340.  An east wing was completed in 1970 and a west one in 2005.  The west wing added 60,000 square feet (5,574 m2) of new space to the building.  The original Washington Avenue bronze entrance doors to the building were designed by artist Nathan Glick.  They depict eight scenes from Alabama history.  Following many years of wear they were relocated to the Ocllo S. Malone Lobby in the new west wing.  The first and second floors of the Archives building feature walls clad in white Alabama marble.The first floor contains the original Washington Avenue entrance lobby, which features a coffered ceiling with gilt moldings and ceiling medallions.  Other features of the first floor are the Statuary Hall, the Research Room, several auditoriums, a gift shop, and the Ocllo Malone Lobby.\n\n\n=== Museum of Alabama ===\nThe second and third floors contain the Museum of Alabama.  Portraits of people who contributed to the history of the state are hung in various locations on both of these floors.  The second floor contains exhibits featuring the Selma to Montgomery marches, the history of Native Americans in the state from the Pre-Columbian era to the Indian removal, and the history of warfare involving Alabamians from the French Colonial period to the Vietnam War.  The Alabama Sampler Gallery contains Alabama-related artifacts ranging from 19th century clothing to a guitar owned by Hank Williams.  The Hands-On Gallery contains history-related activities for children.  The third floor houses paintings and sculpture.\n\n\n== Directors ==\nThe department has had six directors since its inception.  Thomas McAdory Owen served from 1901 until his death in 1920.  He was succeeded by Marie Bankhead Owen, his wife, who served until her retirement in 1955.  Peter A. Brannon was director from 1955 to 1967, followed by Milo Howard.  Howard served until Edwin Bridges took over in 1982.  Bridges served until his retirement in 2012.

"Giovanni_Dandolo| 1289 deaths| House of Dandolo| 13th-century Doges of Venice| ","Giovanni Dandolo was the 48th Doge of Venice, elected late in his life on 31 March 1280, died on 2 November 1289. During his reign the first Venetian gold ducat was introduced into circulation.\n\n\n== Family ==\nDandolo came from a prominent Venetian family that provided three other doges to Venice: Enrico Dandolo, Francesco Dandolo and Andrea Dandolo. Two women from the Dandolo family married doges:  Giovanna Dandolo with Pasquale Malipiero and Zilia Dandolo with Lorenzo Priuli.\nDandolo is a distant relative of many famous figures in Italian history, such as Fra Angelico, Eugenio Canfari, Benito Mussolini. \nBut belonging to the branch of the parish of S. Mois\u00e8, he was the son of Giberto who had defeated the Genoese in the battle near Settepozzi, and of Maria of Gratone Dandolo of S. Polo. According to all the oldest genealogies his grandfather was called Giacomo: it is therefore to be considered a mistake of the most recent literature the attribution to him of the vicedoge Raniero as an ancestor and then of the Doge Enrico as great-grandfather.Giovanni Dandolo was married to some one named Caterina.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBefore his election as doge, Dandolo occupied various public positions including Podest\u00e0 of Bologna and Padua, and commander of the Venetian naval units. The news of his election to doge reached him while he was fighting in a military action against Istria and Trieste, which expanded into an open war in the following year, also involving Venice's perennial enemy, the Patriarchate of Aquileia and the Papal States. More armed clashes followed, and continued for the duration of Dandolo's reign as doge.\nAfter Dandolo signed the peace Treaty of Ravenna with Ancona, a new military theater opened through the revolt in Crete led by the Greek noble Alexios Kallergis and backed by the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII, Venice's rival for the domination of the eastern Mediterranean. These conflicts forced the Republic of Venice to negotiate peace agreements with Charles of Anjou and Philip III of France, concluding an alliance with the former in the Treaty of Orvieto.\nDuring Dandolo's reign as doge, relations with the Vatican were tense.  Venice had refused to join the Papal States in a punitive action against Sicily, provoking Pope Martin IV to excommunicate Venice, which was later repealed in 1285 by Martin's successor, Pope Honorius IV. In 1287 unrest flared up again in Istria and spread to Friuli. The war widened after the intervention of the German Emperor Rudolf I, who was allied with the Patriarchate of Aquileia, and Venice had to sue for peace.\n\nIn 1284, the first Venetian gold ducat, later called the Zecchino, was introduced into circulation. The ducat would be used until the end of the Venetian Republic and was always made with the same weight, 3.56 grams of 24 karat (99.7%) gold.  The coin was valid in all states with which Venice traded. The name ducat comes from the inscription on the coin's back:  Sit tibi Christe datus quem tu regis iste ducatus, which frames a picture of Christ. The front of each coin showed the ruling doges on their knees in front of the city's patron saint, Mark the Evangelist.\nDandolo was buried in San Zanipolo. The tomb was not preserved, only a stone slab with an inscription commemorates the doge.\n\n\n== References ==\nHelmut Dumler: Venedig und die Dogen. D\u00fcsseldorf 2001."

He was an important figure in the early history of the movement but later fell out of favour.\n\n\n== Falangism ==\nD\u00e1vila was a cousin of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera and as such was given the responsibility of expanding the operations of the Falange in Seville and C\u00e1diz in 1933. He soon rose to the rank of jefe territorial for Andalusia. He was a close ally of Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1inz Nothnagel and was arrested with him in May 1936 at Jos\u00e9 Antonio's house.\n\n\n== Power struggle ==\nFollowing the execution of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, D\u00e1vila joined with his ally Agust\u00edn Aznar in a power struggle for the leadership of the Falange. The two men led the legitimistas group within the movement which opposed the leadership of Primo de Rivera's nominated successor Manuel Hedilla. D\u00e1vila's presence was especially important to this group due to his familial connection and he was central in maintaining the cult of El Ausente (the absent), as Primo de Rivera was to be known. In the struggle that followed the legitimista militia seized power for themselves and on April 16, 1937 set up a triumvirate made up of  D\u00e1vila, Aznar and Jos\u00e9 Moreno at the head of the Falange. However, with the help of nazi German agent Carl von Haartman, Hedilla's forces recaptured the Falange HQ from D\u00e1vila and before long Francisco Franco stepped in, ostensibly to support Hedilla but in fact to create the Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista and thus effectively eliminate the Falange and its leaders as threats to his position. D\u00e1vila was imprisoned following the incident although his close friend Gonzalo Queipo de Llano intervened to secure his release.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nIn a snub from Franco, he was not named as a National Delegate until 1938 at a time when a number of pro-Nazis were added to this office. He was replaced as delegate to the Frente de Juventudes in 1941 by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Elola-Olaso as the influence of D\u00e1vila's ally Ram\u00f3n Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er began to wane.Between 1952 and 1954 he served as the President of the Royal Spanish Football Federation.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Sancho D\u00e1vila y Fern\u00e1ndez de Celis at Wikimedia Commons"

"Small_nucleolar_RNA_SNORD64| Small nuclear RNA| Molecular and cellular biology stubs| ","In molecular biology, SNORD64 (also known as HBII-13)  is a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecule which functions in the biogenesis (modification) of other small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). This type of modifying RNA is located in the nucleolus of the eukaryotic cell which is a major site of snRNA biogenesis. It is known as a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and also often referred to as a guide RNA.\nSNORD64 belongs to the C/D box class of snoRNAs which contain the conserved sequence motifs known as the C box (UGAUGA) and the D box (CUGA). Most of the members of the box C/D family function in directing site-specific 2'-O-methylation of substrate RNAs.snoRNA HBII-13 is expressed mainly in the tissues of brain, but is also in the lungs, the kidneys and muscle; however HBII-13 has no identified target RNA.\nThe HBII-13 gene is located in a 460 kb intron of the large paternally-expressed transcription unit (SNURF-SNRNP-UBE3A AS) along with several other snoRNAs HBII-436, HBII-437, HBII-438A/B and the clusters of HBII-85, HBII-52.

It had an estimated moment magnitude of 7.1\u20137.2 and a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe). The shock was centered near the Mexico\u2013United States border and takes its name from a large dry lake bed in Baja California, Mexico. There were no reported casualties, but the event affected the then largely-uninhabited areas of northern Mexico and Southern California.\n\n\n== Tectonic setting ==\n\nThe Salton Trough is part of the complex plate boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate where it undergoes a transition from the continental transform of the San Andreas Fault system to the series of short spreading centers of the East Pacific Rise linked by oceanic transforms in the Gulf of California. The southern part of the trough is divided into two by the Sierra Cucapa and Sierra Mayor ranges forming the Mexicali Valley to the east and the Laguna Salada to the west. The western side of these ranges is formed by the Laguna Salada Fault, which forms a possible continuation of the Elsinore Fault Zone of southern California.\nThe Laguna Salada Fault shows combined normal (down to the southwest) and dextral (right-lateral) movement. Prior to 2010 it showed evidence of recent (probably historical) displacement with a 22 km (14 mi) zone of surface faulting, and 3\u20134 m (9.8\u201313.1 ft) of vertical displacement. This is interpreted to be associated with the 1892 earthquake.\n\n\n== Earthquake ==\nThe earthquake was felt over a wide area from Los Angeles and San Bernardino in the north to San Quintin in the south. The area in which the perceived intensity of shaking reached VIII (Severe) or more was centered on the mapped fault rupture.\n\n\n=== Damage ===\nA report from the Los Angeles Times the following day stated no damage was found in Los Angeles, but also specified that severe shocks were felt in San Diego. Masonry walls were cracked in several buildings there, as well as the outlying communities of Otay and Jamul. At the abandoned Carrizo Creek Stage Station, in what is now Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in eastern San Diego county, poorly built masonry was damaged and all adobe buildings were destroyed. At Hook Ranch and Laguna Station the shaking was strong enough to throw people off their feet and at Dulzura Canyon and McCain Valley the ground was seen to move in waves. There were rockfalls at Bratton Valley, Tierra Blanca Canyon, Storm Canyon and Whale Peak and landslides at Dulzura Canyon and Devil's Canyon.\n\n\n=== Aftershocks ===\nAt Campo, California 155 aftershocks were felt in the first 12 hours after the mainshock and continued every few days for the next two months.\n\n\n== Other events ==\nThe Laguna Salada fault moved again during the 2010 Baja California earthquake.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of earthquakes in California\nList of earthquakes in the United States\nList of historical earthquakes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRupture Pattern of the 1892 Laguna Salada Earthquake: A Precursor to 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah \u2013 Southern California Earthquake Center"

"Kalam_language| Languages of Papua New Guinea| Kalam languages| Pandanus avoidance registers| ","Kalam is a Kalam language of Papua New Guinea. It is closely related to Kobon, and shares many of the features of that language.

"Sighthill,_Glasgow| Areas of Glasgow| Housing estates in Glasgow| Springburn| ","Sighthill is a neighbourhood in the Scottish city of Glasgow. It is situated north of the River Clyde and is part of the wider Springburn district in the north of the city. It is bordered to the north by Cowlairs, to the east by the Springburn Bypass road and the Royston neighbourhood, to the west by the Glasgow to Edinburgh via Falkirk Line (running into Queen Street Station) and to the south by the Townhead interchange of the M8 Motorway.\nThe district is primarily residential and from the mid-1960s consisted of a housing estate split into two sub-areas \u2013  Pinkston to the south and Fountainwell to the north \u2013 each with five 20-storey 'slab' tower blocks, plus seven 5-storey maisonette blocks and five rows of tenements in between. Most of these buildings were demolished in stages during the early 21st century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSighthill formed part of the Springburn Comprehensive Development Area (CDA), and was one of the 20 CDA's around the city where slum housing was completely demolished and replaced by new concrete housing estates based on contemporary architectural practices.  Designed by Crudens Ltd, the housing scheme was built by Glasgow Corporation Housing Department between 1964 and 1969 as part of the city's housing replacement programme \u2013 the existing housing in the area itself, consisting of tenements on Springburn Road and just off it at Huntingdon Place, was demolished in the process. Much of the land used for the Pinkston sector was known as the 'Soda Waste', derelict ground on which the United Alkali Company's St. Rollox Chemical Works, founded by Charles Tennant and at one time the largest chemical manufacturer in the world, used to dump waste chemicals (particularly hydrogen sulfide, a byproduct of the Leblanc process) until its closure in 1964. The Chemical Works was located on the north bank of the Monkland Canal, immediately east of Port Dundas. The Fountainwell sector was built on a farm of the same name, to the south of Sighthill Cemetery which opened in 1840. Within it stands the memorial to John Baird and Andrew Hardie, the leaders of the 1820 Radical War otherwise known as the 1820 Insurrection. William Mossman and his sculptor sons are buried here.\nThe Pinkston power station, which had supplied power to the city's tram system and the Subway, was closed in 1975, and its signature cooling tower which dominated the city's skyline was demolished in 1977, with the rest of the complex being removed the year after.\nThe Sighthill estate later suffered from stigma, as high-rise living went out of fashion. It suffered from low demand since the mid-1970s, despite its proximity to the city centre. Because of its low occupancy rate, Sighthill (along with nearby Red Road) was selected in the late 1990s as a temporary housing location for refugees and asylum seekers. As a result, the neighbourhood had one of the most diverse ethnic makeups in Scotland.\nIn 2005, letting was suspended in the Fountainwell side of Sighthill as new landlords, Glasgow Housing Association considered the estate's future. The decision was eventually made that Fountainwell should be demolished. The first two blocks were demolished in July 2008 with the three remaining blocks following in November 2009. Sighthill Primary School was also demolished after the tower blocks due to an arson attack shortly after it closed.\nThe fate of the five remaining Pinkston blocks was debated further. After a campaign by local residents, at least two of the blocks were to be retained and refurbished by Glasgow Housing Association, with three being demolished or sold to private developers. However, Glasgow then bid for the 2018 Youth Olympics and were added to the hosting shortlist, but the successful city had to have its Athletes Village prepared \u2013  this resulted in the total demolition of Sighthill's towers to accommodate a new low-rise revelopment. The bid was lost, but regeneration continued. The Sighthill 'Transformational Regeneration Area' includes a new school campus, landscaped green areas, enhanced pedestrian bridge to the city centre and better connectivity to the Forth and Clyde Canal, in addition to approximately 1,000 new housing units for sale, private rental and social rental (much of it marketed as 'NorthBridge' by developers Keepmoat).There is also an active Community Council consisting of several committed residents who aim to deal with issues affecting the Sighthill neighbourhood.\n\n\n== Sighthill stone circle ==\nSighthill hosts the first astronomically aligned stone circle built in Great Britain for 3,000 years, guided by Duncan Lunan. Built at the highest point of Sighthill Park, the stone circle has a vantage point over the surrounding areas. There are 17 stones in the circle \u2013 with 16 forming a circle 30 feet (9 metres) across, and the largest four-tonne stone in the centre. The Sighthill megalith was intended as a tribute to both the ancient megalith builders and the scientists who discovered their significance. It was renovated in the late 2010s along with the rest of the district.\n\n\n== Tower blocks ==\nEach block contained 228 flats (i.e. 2,280 residences in total across the 10 blocks); essentially each block was two towers, each with 19 habitable floors of six flats in a mirror-image of the other and a separate communal entrance, joined together at a central wall. They were 57.6 metres (189 ft) tall.\n\n\n=== Fountainwell ===\nIn order of Demolition\n\nEagle Heights (2-4 Fountainwell Place) Cruden 1 (demolished: 13 July 2008)\nBarony Heights (16-18 Fountainwell Place) Cruden 2 (demolished: 13 July 2008)\nTennant Heights (37-49 Fountainwell Avenue) Cruden 3 (demolished: 29 November 2009)\nPhoenix Heights (6-8 Fountainwell Square) Cruden 5 (demolished: 29 November 2009)\nSt. Rollox Heights (2-4 Fountainwell Terrace) Cruden 4 (demolished: 29 November 2009)\n\n\n=== Pinkston ===\nParson Heights (16-18 Pinkston Drive) (demolished June 2013)\nHuntingdon Heights (17-19 Pinkston Drive) (demolished September/October 2013)\nPinkston Heights (3-5 Pinkston Drive) (demolished April 2014)\nCrawfurd Heights (31-35 Pinkston Drive) (demolished March\u2013June 2016)\nHartfield Heights (32-34 Pinkston Drive) (demolished July\u2013October 2016)\n\n\n== See also ==\nGlasgow tower blocks\nList of tallest voluntarily demolished buildings\nTowers in the park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSighthill Stone Circle\nSighthill Community Council (on Facebook)\nWebsite of St Rollox, the local church\nWebsite of St Mungo, the local chapel\nSpringburn Virtual Museum"

"Internal_erosion| Dams| Erosion| ","Internal erosion is the formation of voids within a soil caused by the removal of material by seepage. It is the second most common cause of failure in levees and one of the leading causes of failures in earth dams, responsible for about half of embankment dam failures.Internal erosion occurs when the hydraulic forces exerted by water seeping through the pores and cracks of the material in the dam and/or foundation are sufficient to detach particles and transport them out of the dam structure.\nInternal erosion is especially dangerous because there may be no external evidence, or only subtle evidence, that it is taking place. Usually a sand boil can be found, but the boil might be hidden under water. A dam may breach within a few hours after evidence of internal erosion becomes obvious.\nPiping is a related phenomenon and is defined as the progressive development of internal erosion by seepage, appearing downstream as a hole discharging water.  Piping is induced by regressive erosion of particles from downstream and along the upstream line towards an outside environment until a continuous pipe is formed.\n\n\n== Internal erosion and the piping process ==\nAccording to the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD), there are four general failure modes for internal erosion of embankment dams and their foundations:\nThrough the embankment\nThrough the foundation\nEmbankment-into-foundation\nAssociated with through-penetrating structuresThe process of internal erosion occurs across four phases: initiation of erosion, progression to form a pipe, surface instability, and, lastly, initiation of a breach.  Internal erosion is also classified in four types, dependent on failure path, how the erosion initiates and progresses, and its location:\n\nConcentrated leak: seeping water erodes and enlarges a crack until a breach occurs.  The crack may not progress to the exit (albeit failure is still possible), but eventually the continued erosion forms a pipe or a sinkhole.\nBackward erosion: initiated at the exit point of the seepage path, this type of erosion occurs when the hydraulic gradient is sufficiently high to cause particle detachment and transport; a pipe forms backwards from the exit point until breach.\nSuffusion: occurs in soils with a wide range of particle sizes.  Finer soil particles are eroded through the voids between coarser particles.  Soils susceptible to suffusion are termed internally unstable.  Suffusion can only occur if the volume occupied by the finer particles is lower than the available void space between the coarse particles.\nSoil contact erosion: a phenomenon called sheet flow occurs at interfaces between coarse and fine soils.  Water seeps along the interface between the two soils, eroding the particles from the finer layer into the coarser layer.\n\n\n=== Concentrated leak ===\nConcentrated leaks occur when cracks form in the soil.  The cracks must be below reservoir level, and water pressure needs to be present to maintain the open pipe.  It is possible for water flow to cause the sides of the pipe to swell, closing it and thus limiting erosion.  Additionally, if the soil lacks sufficient cohesion to maintain a crack, the crack will collapse and concentrated leak erosion will not progress to a breach.  Cracks that allow concentrated leaks can arise due to many factors, including:\n\nCross-valley arching resulting in vertical stresses on the sides of the dam\nCore arching on the shoulders of the embankment\nDifferential settlement (above 0.2% differential, a crack forming is almost certain)\nSmall scale irregularities during core treatment (e.g. due to poor compaction)\nCracks and gaps adjacent to spillways or abutment walls or around conduits\nVarious environmental factors like desiccation, settlement during earthquakes, freezing, animal burrows, vegetation/roots.Longitudinal cracks arise from the spreading of the embankment, while transverse openings, which are much more common, are due to vertical settlement of the dam.  The hydraulic shear stress \u03c4c required for the initiation of concentrated leak erosion can be estimated using laboratory testing, such as the hole erosion test (HET).\n\n\n=== Backward erosion ===\n\nBackward erosion often occurs in non-plastic soils such as fine sands. It can occur in sandy foundations, within the dam or levee, or in cofferdams under high flood pressures during construction, causing unravelling at the downstream face. Backward erosion is most often exhibited by the presence of sand boils at the downstream side of dams. Experiments from Sellmeijer and co-workers have shown that backwards erosion initiates in a slot through the strata that overlays the eroding soil (e.g. through excavations or drainage ditches) and then progress in many, smaller pipes (less than 2mm in height) rather than a single one. The stability of the pipes is dependent on the head, and once this is larger than a critical value (0.3-0.5 of flow path length), the channel extends upstream. Beyond this, at any head greater than the critical value, erosion progresses until eventually the pipes break through to the upstream reservoir, at which point breach occurs. In order for backwards erosion to occur, the dam or levee body must form and maintain a \u2018roof\u2019 for the pipe.\n\n\n=== Suffusion ===\nSuffusion occurs when water flows through widely-graded or gap-graded, cohesionless soils. The finer particles are transported by seepage, and the coarse particles carry most of the effective stress. Suffusion can only occur provided the fine soil particles are small enough to pass between the coarse particles and do not fill the voids in the coarser soil. Water flow velocity must also be sufficient to transport those fine particles.\nSuffusion leads to increased permeability in the embankment core, greater seepage velocities and possibly hydraulic fractures. It can also lead to settlement  if it occurs in the dam foundation. Soils subject to suffusion also tend to be affected by segregation. The Kenney-Lau approach is a renowned method for the analysis of suffusion, which uses the particle size distribution to assess the internal stability of a soil, which directly affects the likelihood of suffusion occurring.\n\n\n=== Soil contact erosion ===\nSoil contact erosion occurs when sheet flow (water flow parallel to an interface) erodes fine soil in contact with coarse soil. Contact erosion is largely dependent on the flow velocity, which must be sufficient to detach and transport the finer particles, as well as the finer soil particles being able to pass through the pores in the coarse layer. When contact erosion is initiated, a cavity is formed, leading to a reduction of stress. The roof of the cavity then collapses; the collapsed material is transported away resulting in a larger cavity. The process continues until the formation of a sinkhole. It is possible for a cavity to not collapse; this will lead to backward erosion occurring.\nSoil contact erosion can occur between any granular layer and a finer soil such as in silt-gravel, and often results in a loss of stability, increases in pore pressure and clogging of the permeable layer. \nExperimental results show that close to the geometrical limit, the point at which the fine particles can just pass between the coarse particles(the filter criterion), erosion initiation and failure are much more likely.\n\n\n== Prevention using filters ==\nIt is possible to interrupt the process of internal erosion with the use of filters. Filters trap eroded particles while still allowing seepage, and are normally coarser and more permeable than the filtered soil. The type of filter required and its location is dependent on which zones of the dam are most susceptible to internal erosion. Per regulation, filters need to satisfy five conditions:\nRetention: the filter must limit or interrupt the transport of eroded soil particles.\nSelf-filtration: also defined as stability, the filter must be internally stable.\nNo cohesion: the filter must not have the ability to maintain cracks or the ability to cement.\nDrainage: the filter must be sufficiently permeable to allow water pressure to dissipate.\nStrength: the filter must be capable of transferring stresses within the dam without being crushed.\n\n\n== References =="

Knopf and starring Greer Garson, Michael Wilding and Fernando Lamas. It is based on the 1925 play The Last of Mrs. Cheyney by Frederick Lonsdale, and was not related to the Wilkie Collins novel The Law and the Lady. Previous film versions of the story had been made in 1929 and 1937.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nJane Hoskins (Garson) has worked most of her life as a lady's maid, and is currently employed by Lord Minden and his haughty wife Lady Sybil Minden. Lord Minden's younger twin brother, The Honourable Nigel Duxbury (Wilding) received only ten thousand pounds to his brother's five million because his brother was born five minutes before him and is therefore seen as being the elder sibling in the eyes of the law. Having squandered his money, Nigel sneaks into his brother's home and steals Lady Minden's earrings. Lady Minden accuses her maid Jane of the theft until Nigel steps forward and claims responsibility. Jane is angry at being wrongly accused of theft by her employer and decides to quit her job and make her way into high society.\nNigel is impressed by Jane's attitude and, after securing the earrings in return for never bothering his brother again, he offers to take Jane out for an evening of fine dining. Together they unintentionally con a wealthy gentleman into believing that Jane is a wealthy widow, the Lady Lovely, and that she collects donations for a fictional Egyptian charity called The Nile Fund. At the end of the night, one hundred pounds wealthier, Jane makes a business arrangement with Nigel that the two of them should work together as confidence tricksters.\nJane and Nigel travel to Monte Carlo, San Remo and Shanghai, where they cheat at gambling and are repeatedly asked by the authorities to leave the country. Eventually they make their way to San Francisco, where Nigel suggests they move into jewellery theft. Nigel gets himself a job as a butler named Hoskins in the house of society queen Julia Wortin (Marjorie Main), and Jane befriends Mrs Wortin and is invited to the house as a guest. The two plan to lift Julia's diamond necklace during their stay.\nJulia throws a party in Jane's honour and her exotic neighbor Juan (Lamas) begins to woo Jane. Jane becomes somewhat swept off her feet at Juan's attentions to her, causing Nigel to become jealous. On the first night of her stay, Jane locates Julia's safe and the necklace, but is touched by the lady's kindness towards her and has second thoughts about their plan, so she does not go through with it. The following day Jane receives a proposal from Juan and decides to accept. Jane and Nigel argue about Jane's decision, and although they share a kiss, they are reluctant to admit their feelings for one another, having long ago agreed that theirs was a strictly business relationship.\nJane decides to steal the necklace and give it to Nigel because she is worried about his future now that she will no longer be his partner in crime. Juan sees her give the necklace to Nigel and has already discovered that she is not really Lady Lovely. Juan and his servant apprehend Nigel, and Juan forces himself into Jane's room, where she activates the burglar alarm. Realising that Juan is not going to give her away, Jane reveals that she is a thief to Julia. Nigel turns up with a letter from one of Julia's other house guests which contains libelous information with which he and Jane can blackmail Julia and her guests if they decide to turn Jane and Nigel over to the police. The guests bid for ownership of the libelous letter, but Jane decides to give it to Juan for free for his kindness. Julia thinks the whole evening has been a bit of excitement and asks Jane and Nigel to stay on.\nThe following morning, after fighting over Jane the night before, Juan and Nigel inform Jane that they have decided Juan should be the one she ends up with. Jane reveals her true love for Nigel by yelling at him for letting her down and revealing that she has always loved him but that he was \"

She is most known for her play By the Pike's Wish (1936).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nYelizaveta Tarakhovskaya (born Parnokh) was born in the city of Taganrog on July 26, 1891 in a pharmacist's family. She is sister to poet Sophia Parnok and twin sister to founder of Soviet Russian jazz Valentin Parnakh. She graduated from the Taganrog Girls Gymnasium, later studied in Bestuzhev courses in Saint Petersburg and started to write poems in her childhood.\n\nIn 1925, her first books were published: On How Chocolate Came to MosSelProm and Tit Will Fly. Since then, she wrote many children's books, including Metropolitan (1932), The Moon and the Lazy Fellow (1933), The Seagull (1965, dedicated to Valentina Tereshkova, Soviet Russian cosmonaut, the first woman to go into space). She is the author of poems for grown-ups: The Violin Clef (1958), The Bird (1965). The verses of Tarakhovskaya are lyrical, thoughtful, and almost always full of humor, with most of them being the poetry of ordinary and everyday things around.\nYelizaveta Tarakhovskaya translated into Russian many poems for children written by various Soviet and foreign authors: verses of Polish poet Julian Tuwim, Uzbek poet Kuddus Muhammadi (Muhammadiev), Azerbaijani poet Mirvari Dilbazi, Georgian poet Mariki Baratashvili(\u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\u10d9\u10d0 \u10d1\u10d0\u10e0\u10d0\u10d7\u10d0\u10e8\u10d5\u10d8\u10da\u10d8), Lithuanian poet Eduardas Mie\u017eelaitis, Bulgarian poet Assen Bossev and many more.\nToday Tarakhovskaya is probably most known for her play By the Pike's Wish, which was staged by Sergey Obraztsov in the Moscow State Academic Puppet Show named after Serguei Obraztsov in November 1936 and has remained in the theater's repertoire ever since. The play By the Pike's Wish (Po shchuchuyemu veleniyu) is considered by theater experts as the greatest puppet show of the 20th century, making quintessence of Meyerhold's methods. It was also released as a motion picture in 1938 (directed by Aleksandr Rou).\nYelizaveta Tarakhovskaya died in Moscow on November 11, 1968 and was buried on Novodevichy Cemetery near her twin-brother Valentin.A memorial plaque dedicated to Parnok family was placed on the wall of their birth house in Taganrog in 2012.\n\n\n== Works (alphabetical list) ==\n\n12 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u043f\u044f\u0442\u0438 /  \u041c.: \u0413\u0438\u0437, 1930.\n\u0411\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043d! / \u041c.: \u041c\u043e\u043b. \u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u044f, 1932.\n\u0411\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043d! / \u041c.: \u0413\u0438\u0437, 1930.\n\u0411\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043d! / \u0418\u0437\u0434. 3-\u0435. \u041c.: \u041c\u043e\u043b. \u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u044f, 1930.\n\u0412\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 / \u041c.; \u041b.: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442, 1937.\n\u0413\u0434\u0435 \u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0445\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430? / \u041c.; \u041b.: \u0413\u0438\u0437, 1930.\n\u0414\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0430 /\u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442: \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u0423\u0437. \u0421\u0421\u0420, 1942.\n\u0416\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430 / \u041c.: \u0413. \u0424. \u041c\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432, 1928.\n\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u0432 \u0441\u0430\u0434 / \u041c.; \u041b.: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0433\u0438\u0437, 1949.\n\u041a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b \u0432 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0435 / \u041c.: \u0413\u0438\u0437, 1930.\n\u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044f, \u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f / \u041b.: \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0433\u0430, 1929.\n\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e / \u041c.: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0433\u0438\u0437, 1951.\n\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e. \u0418\u0437\u0434. 3-\u0435. \u041c.; \u041b.: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442, 1938.\n\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043d / \u041c.: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0433\u0438\u0437, 1935.\n\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043d / \u0418\u0437\u0434. 2-\u0435. \u041c.: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442, 1936.\n\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043d / \u041c.: \u041c\u043e\u043b. \u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u044f, 1932.\n\u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043c / \u0418\u0437\u0434. 2-\u0435. \u041c.; \u041b.: \u041c\u043e\u043b. \u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u044f, 1931.\n\u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043c / 1928.\n\u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043c / \u041c.; \u041b.: \u0413\u0438\u0437, 1930.\n\u041e \u0442\u043e\u043c, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043b \u0448\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0434 \u0432 \u041c\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c /\u0420\u044f\u0437\u0430\u043d\u044c: \u0418\u0437\u0434. \"

"Trifluoromethylation| Organic reactions| ","Trifluoromethylation in organic chemistry describes any organic reaction that introduces a trifluoromethyl group in an organic compound. Trifluoromethylated compounds are of some importance in pharmaceutical industry and agrochemicals. Several notable pharmaceutical compounds have a trifluoromethyl group incorporated: fluoxetine, mefloquine, Leflunomide, nulitamide, dutasteride, bicalutamide, aprepitant, celecoxib, fipronil, fluazinam, penthiopyrad, picoxystrobin, fluridone, norflurazon, sorafenib and triflurazin. A relevant agrochemical is trifluralin. The development of synthetic methods for adding trifluoromethyl groups to chemical compounds is actively pursued in academic research.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first to investigate trifluoromethyl groups in relationship to biological activity was F. Lehmann in 1927. An early review appeared in 1958. An early synthetic method was developed by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Swarts in 1892, based on antimony fluoride. In this reaction benzotrichloride was reacted with SbF3 to form PhCF2Cl and\nPhCF3. In the 1930s Kinetic Chemicals and IG Farben replaced SbF3 with HF.\nThe McLoughlin-Thrower reaction (1968) is an early coupling reaction using iodofluoroalkanes, iodoaromatic compounds and copper. In 1969 Kobayashi & Kumadaki adapted their protocol for trifluoromethylations.\n\n\n== Reagents ==\n\n\n=== Trifluoromethyltrimethylsilane ===\nPreparation of the trifluoromethyltrimethylsilane was reported by Ingo Ruppert in 1984. In 1989, Prakash and Olah first reported activation of TMSCF3 by fluoride to perform nucleophilic trifluoromethylation of carbonyl compounds. In the same year, Stahly described similar reactions for the synthesis of trifluoromethylated phenols and anilines. Since then TMSCF3 has been widely used as a nucleophilic trifluoromethylating agent.An example is the trifluoromethylation of cyclohexanone in THF using tetrabutylammonium fluoride.\nThe substrates can be aryl halides. Potassium (trifluoromethyl)trimethoxyborate for this purpose has been synthesised from B(OMe)3, CF3SiMe3 and KF. Aryl functionalization by C-H activation has also been reported.\n\n\n=== Sodium trifluoroacetate ===\nSodium trifluoroacetate as a reagent for trifluoromethylations was introduced by Matsui in 1981. In the original scope the substrate was an aromatic halide and the metal salt copper(I)iodide.\n\n\n=== Trifluoromethane ===\nFluoroform (CF3H) has been employed as a trifluoromethylation reagent for aldehydes in combination with a strong base\n\n\n=== Trifluoroiodomethane ===\nTrifluoroiodomethane is a reagent in aromatic coupling reactions. It has also been used with enones, for example with chalcone, a reaction catalysed by diethyl zinc and Wilkinson's catalyst:\n\n\n=== Trifluoromethyl sulfone ===\nTrifluoromethyl sulfone (PhSO2CF3) and trifluoromethyl sulfoxide (PhSOCF3) can be used for trifluoromethylations of electrophiles\n\n\n=== Trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride ===\nTrifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride (or triflyl chloride, CF3SO2Cl) can be used in a highly efficient method to introduce a trifluoromethyl group to aromatic and heteroaromatic systems, including known pharmaceuticals such as Lipitor. The chemistry is general and mild, and uses a photoredox catalyst and a light source at room temperature.\n\n\n=== Sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate ===\nSodium trifluoromethanesulfinate (CF3SO2Na) as a trifluoromethylation reagent was introduced by Langlois in 1991. The reaction requires t-butyl hydroperoxide and generally a metal and proceeds through a radical mechanism. The reagent has been applied with heterocyclic substrates\n\n\n=== Umemoto reagents ===\nUmemoto reagents are (trifluoromethyl)dibenzoheterocyclic salts.\n\n\n=== Trifluoromethyl-metal reagents ===\nMany CF3-containing metal complexes have been prepared, and some are useful for trifluoromethylation. The most obvious reagent is CF3Li, which can be generated by lithium-iodide exchange.  This compound is however unstable even at low temperatures.  It degrades to lithium fluoride and difluorocarbene.  Trifluoromethyl copper(I) reagents are more useful.  These reagents are generated in situ by reaction of CF3I with copper powder in polar solvents.   Hg(CF3)2, prepared by decarboxylation of the trifluoroacetate, has proven useful for the trifluoromethylation of other metals.\n\n\n== Reaction types ==\n\n\n=== Aromatic coupling reactions ===\nIn coupling reactions between aromatic compounds and metal-trifluoromethyl complexes the metal is usually copper, Pd and Ni are less prominent. The reactions are stoichiometric or catalytic. In the McLoughlin-Thrower reaction (1962) iodobenzene reacts with trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I) and copper powder  in dimethylformamide at 150 \u00b0C to trifluoromethylbenzene. The intermediate in this reaction type is a perfluoromethyl-metal complex.\nA palladium acetate catalysed reaction described in 1982 used zinc powder with the main intermediate believed to be CF3ZnI with Pd(0) is the active catalyst. The first copper catalysed coupling was reported in 2009 and based on an iodoarene, a trifluoromethylsilane, copper iodide and 1,10-phenanthroline. Variations include another CF3 donor potassium (trifluoromethyl)trimethoxyborate, the use of aryl boronic acids or the use of a trifluoromethyl sulfonium salt or the use of a trifluoromethylcopper(I) phenanthroline complex. A catalytic palladium catalysed reaction was reported in 2010 using aryl halides, (trifluoromethyl)triethylsilane and allylpalladium chloride dimer\n\n\n=== Radical trifluoromethylation ===\nIn radical trifluoromethylation the active species is the trifluoromethyl free radical. Reagents such as bromotrifluoromethane and haloform have been used for this purpose but in response to the Montreal Protocol alternatives such as trifluoroiodomethane have been developed as replacement. One particular combination is CF3I / triethylborane\nOther reagents that generate the CF3 radical are sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate and bis(trifluoroacetyl) peroxide.\n\nIn the CF3 radical the fluorine atom is an electron-withdrawing group via the inductive effect but also a weak pi donor through interaction of the fluorine lone pair with the radical center's SOMO. Compared to the methyl radical the CF3 radical is pyramidal (angle 107.8 \u00b0C ) with a large inversion barrier, electrophilic and also more reactive. In reaction with styrene it is 440 times more reactive. An early report (1949) describes the photochemical reaction of iodotrifluoromethane with ethylene to 3-iodo-1,1,1-trifluoropropane. Reagents that have been reported for the direct trifluoromethylation of arenes are CF3I, CF3Br (thermal or photochemical), silver trifluoroacetate/TiO2 (photochemical) and sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate/Cu(OSO2CF3)2/tBuOOH.\n\n\n=== Nucleophilic trifluoromethylation ===\nIn nucleophilic trifluoromethylation the active species is the CF3\u2212 anion. It was, however, widely believed that the trifluoromethyl anion is a transient species and thus cannot be isolated or observed in the condensed phase.  Contrary to the popular belief, the CF3 anion, with [K(18-crown-6)]+ as a countercation, was produced and characterized by Prakash and coworkers. The challenges associated with observation of CF3 anion are alluded to its strong basic nature and its tendency to form pentacoordinated silicon species, such as [Me3Si(CF3)2]\u2212 or [Me3Si(F)(CF3)]\u2212.\nThe reactivity of fluoroform in combination with a strong base such as t-BuOK with carbonyl compounds in DMF is an example. Here CF3\u2212 and DMF form an hemiaminolate adduct ([Me2NCH(O)CF3]K).\n\n\n=== Electrophilic trifluoromethylation ===\nIn electrophilic trifluoromethylation the active trifluoromethyl donor group carries a positive charge. Production of an CF3+ cation has been described as \"

His father, Friedrich von Frankenberg, was a German baron of independent means, while his mother, Jessie Elliot, was the daughter of a wealthy Australian industrialist family. Her family owned property in Algeria, where her father resided there for lengthy periods, and the young family spent some time in North Africa. This may be where Von Frankenberg first encountered Islam. He later became an Officer for the German Crown Prince, and developed an interest in collecting rare works on Eastern and Islamic literature.In 1925 and 1926 he attended the Sufi Movement Summer School, led annually by Inayat Khan at Suresnes, in France. He was accepted by Khan as a student (mureed), and given the Sufi name of Momin (meaning faithful), as well as instruction in spiritual practices.In 1927, Von Frankenberg immigrated to Australia. His mother had inherited a substantial estate from her father, but it had been frozen during World War I because Elliot and her son were German nationals.

"Lithuanian_Heavy_Draught| Horse breeds| Horse breeds originating in Lithuania| ","The Lithuanian Heavy Draught is a draught horse breed created in Lithuania during the 19th and 20th centuries. They are used mainly for heavy draught and farm work, as well as meat production and the improvement of other breeds.  The breed is currently near extinction..\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Lithuanian Heavy Draught was created during the late 19th century by crossing local Zhmud mares with Ardennes, Percheron, Brabant, and other heavy breeds.  The breeding was overseen by the Lithuanian Society for Breeding Work and Driving Horses beginning in 1894.  In 1923 additional heavy horses were imported from the Netherlands to re-establish the breed following World War I, and in 1925, 2000, and 2001 additional Ardennes horses were imported from Sweden.Initially, Lithuanian Heavy Draughts were included into herd books as Ardennes crossbreds.  A breed-specific herd book was issued from 1951 to 1996. The herd books for Lithuanian Heavy Draughts are now issued by the Lithuanian Horse Breeders Association, with purebred Lithuanian Draughts identified by their colour, conformation, and markings. In 1964 there were 62,000 Lithuanian Heavy Draughts in Lithuania. Recently, there has been a dramatic decrease in the breed population, with stallion numbers declining and breeding and working conditions deteriorating.  Currently, the breed is close to extinction, with less than 1000 horses thought to exist as of 2003.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe Lithuanian Heavy Draught generally stands 15 to 16 hands high, and may be bay, chestnut, black, grey or roan. Overall the breed is large and solid.  The head is well-proportioned with a straight profile and heavy jaw.  The neck is short, muscular, and arched, the withers broad and moderately pronounced and the chest wide, deep and muscular.  The back is long, and generally straight, although it can be slightly dipped, and the croup rounded, long and muscled.  The legs are short, solid, and muscular with broad, strong joints and well-formed hooves.  Defects occasionally shown include a coarse head and an excessively dipped back.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nThe Lithuanian Heavy Draught is used mainly for heavy draught and farm work. In Lithuania draught capacity testing began in 1857, and since 2002 the Lithuanian Horse Breeders Association has taken over the responsibility of heavy horse testing.  Recently, more have begun to be exported for meat. They are also used to improve other breeds.  When crossed with native Altai horses, they improved the meat and milk yield and also increased the weight, growth rate, and ability to withstand year-round grazing conditions.\n\n\n== References =="
"Global_game| Game theory game classes| ","In economics and game theory, global games are games of incomplete information where players receive possibly-correlated signals of the underlying state of the world. Global games were originally defined by Carlsson and van Damme (1993).The most important practical application of global games has been the study of crises in financial markets such as bank runs, currency crises, and bubbles. However, they have other relevant applications such as investments with payoff complementarities, beauty contests, political riots and revolutions, and any other economic situation which displays strategic complementarity.\n\n\n== Global games in models of currency crises ==\nStephen Morris and Hyun Song Shin (1998) considered a stylized currency crises model, in which traders observe the relevant fundamentals with small noise, and show that this leads to the selection of a unique equilibrium. This result overturns the result in models of complete information, which feature multiple equilibria.\nOne concern with the robustness of this result is that the introduction of a theory of prices in global coordination games may reintroduce multiplicity of equilibria. This concern was addressed in Angeletos and Werning (2006) as well as Hellwig and coauthors (2006). They show that equilibrium multiplicity may be restored by the existence of prices acting as an endogenous public signal, provided that private information is sufficiently precise.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJorge, Jos\u00e9; Rocha, Joana (2015). \"
"99p_Stores| British companies established in 2001| British companies disestablished in 2016| Arts and crafts retailers| Defunct retail companies of the United Kingdom| Variety stores| Retail companies established in 2001| Retail companies disestablished in 2016| Discount shops of the United Kingdom| ","99p Stores Ltd. was a family-run business founded in January 2001 by entrepreneur Nadir Lalani, who opened the first store in the chain in Holloway, London, with a further three stores opening later that year. In 2002, Lalani decided to expand the business throughout the UK and had rapidly developed 99p Stores, operating a total of 129 stores as of March 2010 and serving around 1.5 million customers each week, undercutting their main rival Poundland by a penny. As of mid-2009 the company offered more than 3,500 different product lines throughout its stores.Most of their stores were based in the south of the UK, although there were stores as far north as Liverpool and Hartlepool. The chain saw accelerated store expansion upon the collapse of Woolworths Group, where they took the opportunity to acquire 15 of these former stores, increasing their estate to 79 at that time. Landlords were regarding 99p Stores as an anchor tenant due to the significant number of customers one of their stores could bring to a location.Although the retailer made a pre-tax loss of \u00a31.14 million in the year to 31 January 2007, they claimed that, since then, consumers had become more cautious with their money and where they spend it, in response to the economic conditions. The retailer had noticed an increase of customers from the wealthier AB social grade (a system of demographic classification used in the United Kingdom) during the recession. Customers had tended to speak positively about 99p Stores, with most reviewers noting customer and product overcrowding as their biggest criticisms, yet still rated the chain 4.5/5 on average.In February 2015, Poundland agreed to buy 99p Stores for \u00a355 million, with regulatory approval received in September 2015. The 99p Stores fascia began being phased out in favour of Poundland branding from late 2015.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\n\nNadir Lalani came to the UK in 1973 from Tanzania, having owned a cash and carry store in Mwanza. Since moving to the UK he built up and sold two convenience store chains (including buying Whistlestop Discount Stores, a 27-strong chain which he sold in 2005) before moving into discount retailing, with intentions of handing the business over to his two sons, who also work for the company, in due course. Lalani was inspired to start 99p Stores after stumbling upon a bustling Poundland shop whilst wandering around a shopping centre. His first store opened on 18 January 2001, with over 3,500 customers visiting the store in the first day of trading. As of mid-2009, the company offered more than 3,500 different product lines throughout its stores.\n\n\n=== Growth ===\nThe company relocated their headquarters to a new, 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2) base in Daventry in 2007, giving them capacity to go to 120 stores with existing infrastructure. Discount shops, including 99p Stores, had seen store numbers increase by 60% during the economic downturn, with two discount stores opening for every one store that has closed. The retailer took advantage of the tough economic climate of the late 2000s, having doubled the number of their stores during the period August 2008 - August 2009, and had further plans to double existing store numbers and current market share within the 18 months following October 2009.In August 2009, Retail Week reported that the retailer was to review its ownership structure, potentially resulting in a sale as early as summer 2010 or a flotation within the next three years. The retailer had said they would want 150 shops before considering any offers to buy a stake in the business, mentioning the advantages of a flotation to include further investment, as well as the Lalani family being able to retain a stake and an element of control in the business.\n\n\n=== Management ===\nIn October 2009, the retailer appointed Gordon Brown as their new chairman, who took up the position on 1 October 2009, taking over from Peter Gent. Brown, having previously served as managing director at Wilkinson between 1991 and 2007, joined the company at a time when it was embarking on aggressive expansion and assessing its long-term options.\n\n\n== Business practice ==\n\n\n=== Sales strategy ===\nWhen inflation pushes up prices beyond what the company is able to pay, this is often easily worked around by reducing the quantity supplied in each item, for example by reducing the amount of tape on reels of selotape, or selling eggs by the dozen instead of 18s. Nadir's son and buying director, Faisal, who took care of the day-to-day running, noted that the lowest margin he will work with is 20 percent. In response to the planned VAT rise to 20% in January 2011, the budget chain said it would not change its prices but would stop selling goods that did not make a profit.Towards the end of 2009, 99p Stores replaced their Torex electronic point of sale system with one provided by Futura to operate their touchscreen Intelligent Registers (IRs). As well as allowing the retailer to understand which products customers are buying, through up-to-date tracking of the most popular products, it allowed stock to be moved around the business quickly. Other functionality included its allocation and replenishment capabilities, helping to ensure constant stock via automated ordering. Following a successful pilot (in which the company tested the new system in a select number of stores before committing to it), Futura scheduled an ambitious roll-out programme at the end of 2009 to change both software and platform, reducing the normal roll-out period from six months to two months. The Futura team installed the system with Digipos touch-screen tills each evening after trading, enabling the store to start trading the very next day. Simultaneously, new chip-and-pin capability was being introduced, to ensure the company is PCI compliant, with contactless payments to follow.\n\n\n=== Products offered ===\n\nThe retailer offered a large range of products in its 3,500 lines, from \"

"Vermilacinia_johncassadyi| Lichens described in 1996| Fungi of Mexico| Lichens| Ramalinaceae| ","Vermilacinia johncasadyi is a rare fruticose lichen, found on rocks along the Pacific Coast of Baja California peninsula on Punta Cono, and directly westward across the ocean on Cedros Island.\n\n\n== Distinguishing features ==\nVermilacinia johncassadyi is classified in the subgenus Vermilacinia, distinguished from related species by its thallus divided into strap-like branches arising from a blackened base to about \u00bc the way up the branches, and by producing lichen substances of triterpenes referred to as T1 and T2 in reference to their Rf class on thin-layer chromatography plates.  Apothecia, which develop in some thalli, occur in terminal clusters, sometimes extending down along the branch margins. The strap-like branches are recurved in forms that produce apothecia, and erect in forms lacking apothecia.\nVermilacinia laevigata is morphologically similar to V. johncassadyi in its strap-like branches.  It differs in its lichen substances (contains T3, not T1 and T2), and development of its apothecia elevated from the branch by a short narrower stalk-like lobe, in contrast to apothecia in V.  johncassadyi that appear to pinch off from the branch margins, occurring in aggregate and often not fully developed, the margins notably wavy as a result.\nThe species was named after a chemist, John Cassady, who was Chairman of the Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy at Purdue University, and later Dean of the School of Pharmacy at Ohio State University while the species was under investigation.  He, and his graduate student, Thomas McCloud, had accompanied Richard Spjut on an expedition to Baja California during May 1986 for the collection of plant and lichen samples in search of new chemical compounds for treating cancer.\n\n\n== Lichen substances ==\nVermilacinia johncasadyi contains predominantly terpenes but lacks the T3 compound as noted above, and also lacks accessory depsidones such as salazinic acid. It is one of a small number of species in the genus with a distinctive chemistry of secondary triterpenes referred to as T1 and T2. These triterpenes are found only in subgenus Vermilacinia, and only in species that occur in the central region of Baja California.

"Information_technology_generalist| Computer occupations| ","An information technology generalist is a technology professional proficient in many facets of information technology without any specific specialty. Furthermore, an IT generalist is generally considered to possess general business knowledge and soft skills allowing them to be adaptable in a wide array of work environments. The IT Generalist is often able to fulfill many different roles within a company depending on specific technology needs. In a small business environment, budgets often delegate many different facets of technology to a single individual, especially considering a small business will often require an individual proficient in desktop support, web page design, databases, phone systems, and even server administration. The role of the IT Generalist within a larger company, however, often becomes more of a project leader or integrations specialist due to a project team consisting of a varying degree of IT specialists and interfacing with end-users requiring soft-skills.\n\n\n== Industry role ==\nThe information technology industry consists of many disparate technologies that each serve a critical piece of the total technology puzzle. As technology practices change new methods, techniques, and tools become available that often require human expertise in order to implement and maintain technology systems. The human expertise required in order to manage these new systems has given rise to what is defined as an IT specialist\u2014someone with an expert level of competency and knowledge on a particular piece of technology. In comparison, the IT Generalist does not possess the expert knowledge to implement an advanced system but instead possesses the knowledge and experience to ensure all of the disparate technologies can function properly together.The generalist has become an increasingly valuable asset to a company, especially when it comes to the rapidly changing field of technology. In many cases, companies are more apt to demand hiring and retaining employees that are multi-functional, especially those that have analytical abilities such as critical reasoning and statistical analysis.\n\n\n== Market trends ==\nMarket trends tend to be moving away from the hiring of IT specialists and instead individuals who possess a more broad technical base with additional soft-skills such as enthusiasm, passion, and energy. In even some cases, IT specialists with years of experience may be passed over for more malleable hires because as technology changes innovation may be stifled by specialists not being able to adjust to new procedures and processes in the market. The attributes associated with an IT generalist have been defined in other occupational series as well. In a study conducted over five years with over 250 political science specialists their political predictions were recorded along with a large sample of generalist's political predictions to determine if specialists with their expert knowledge were more effective in their forecasts. The study discovered that those with limited political science exposure were more accurate in their predictions\u2014most likely as a result of their more varied and un-focused exposure to political science as compared to those of the specialists.\n\n\n== Arguments for and against ==\nThe debate between the IT generalist and specialist has been going on for years as companies are trying to determine how to best utilize their IT department skills and assets. Up until recently the general consensus of the market has been the hiring of IT specialists due to the implementation of advanced technologies such as cloud computing, next-generation mobile application development, and the virtualization of technology infrastructure. It has been found, however, that the hiring of specialists has led to the rise of silos of talent within a company leading to difficulty implementing new business processes and taking advantage of inter-departmental collaboration. This compartmentalization of knowledge and skills has led to companies shifting focus to the hiring and implementing of IT Generalists for the purposes of implementing a more mobile, adaptable, and diverse technology department.\nAccording to multiple studies in 2010 companies who were surveyed noted their goal was to reduce the amount of specialists they hire and instead hiring \u201cversatilists.\u201d These versatilists are synonymous with IT Generalists because they have an overall general sense of technology as well as business knowledge while also possessing \u201csoft skills\u201d that are considered lacking in technology-minded individuals focused on specific technology skill-sets.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nTetlock, Philip (2005).

During a 14-year baseball career, he played in the Negro leagues and Major League Baseball from 1948 through 1968, primarily for the New York Yankees. A 12-time All-Star, he also played for the Kansas City Monarchs and the Boston Red Sox. Howard served on the Yankees' coaching staff from 1969 to 1979.\nIn 1955, he was the first African American player on the Yankees roster; this was eight years after Jackie Robinson had broken  the MLB color barrier in 1947. Howard was named the American League's Most Valuable Player for the 1963 pennant winners after finishing third in the league in slugging average and fifth in home runs, becoming the first black player in AL history to win the honor. He won Gold Glove Awards in 1963 and 1964, in the latter season setting AL records for putouts and total chances in a season. His lifetime fielding percentage of .993 as a catcher was a major league record from 1967 to 1973, and he retired among the AL career leaders in putouts (7th, 6,447) and total chances (9th, 6,977).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHoward was born in St. Louis, Missouri to Travis Howard and Emaline Hill, a nurse at a local hospital.

He was an outfielder for three seasons and in 1950 roomed with Ernie Banks.The Yankees signed Howard on July 19, 1950, after he was purchased along with Frank Barnes. They  were assigned to the Muskegon Clippers, the Yankees' farm team in the Central League.Howard missed the 1951 and 1952 seasons due to his military service in the U.S. Army.\nIn 1953, Howard played for the Kansas City Blues of the Class AAA American Association. The next year, the Yankees invited Howard to spring training and converted him into a catcher, despite the presence of Yogi Berra as the Yankees' starting catcher.He played with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Class AAA International League in 1954, where he led the league in triples, with 16, to go along with 22 home runs, 109 runs batted in and a .330 average, winning the league's MVP award.\nThe Yankees assigned Bill Dickey to work with Howard in order to develop his catching skills.\n\n\n== Major league career ==\n\n\n=== 1950s ===\nHoward made the Yankees' major league roster at the start of the 1955 season.

"Hagoth| Book of Mormon people| Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact| Mormonism and Pacific Islanders| Mormon folklore| ","According to the Book of Mormon, Hagoth () was a Nephite ship builder who lived in or around 55 BCE. At least two of the ships he built were lost. The occupants of one ship were presumed drowned. Hagoth and his shipbuilding accomplishments are briefly described in the book of Alma in the Book of Mormon:\n\n 5  And it came to pass that Hagoth, he being an exceedingly curious man, therefore he went forth and built him an exceedingly large ship, on the borders of the land Bountiful, by the land Desolation, and launched it forth into the west sea, by the narrow neck which led into the land northward.   6  And behold, there were many of the Nephites who did enter therein and did sail forth with much provisions, and also many women and children; and they took their course northward. And thus ended the thirty and seventh year.\n   7  And in the thirty and eighth year, this man built other ships. And the first ship did also return, and many more people did enter into it; and they also took much provisions, and set out again to the land northward.\n   8  And it came to pass that they were never heard of more. And we suppose that they were drowned in the depths of the sea. And it came to pass that one other ship also did sail forth; and whither she did go we know not. (Alma 63:5-8)\n\n\n== Polynesian theory ==\nNon-scriptural sources suggest that Hagoth led an expedition, sailing into the Pacific Ocean from the Americas. Some leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and scholars have stated that the peoples of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Polynesia, and New Zealand, are descendants of the Nephite Hagoth and his followers. According to the Book of Mormon, the Nephites were descendants of Israel. Many members of the LDS Church in Polynesia have come to believe that Hagoth is their ancestor. Non-Mormon scholars largely dismiss this hypothesis, citing genetic, archaeological, and anthropological evidence which indicates that Polynesian peoples come from Maritime Southeast Asia.Despite general agreement among scholars that the principal ancestors of Polynesian peoples migrated from Southeast Asia, there are a few evidences of the possibility of contact with peoples in the Western Hemisphere. Sweet potatoes, which are native to South America, are a common traditional staple throughout Polynesia. The Quechua word for sweet potato is kumar, very similar to the Polynesian word kumara for the same plant. There is also DNA evidence of contact between Polynesian and South American peoples prior to European contact.Differentiating between scriptural and apocryphal accounts of Hagoth and his ships, one LDS writer makes the following observations:\n\n The Book of Mormon does not equate the \"

"Political_unitarism| Political terminology| ","Political unitarism designates various theories, concepts or policies that advocate or enforce a fully unified and centralized system of government, with ultimate goal in creating a unitary state. In practice, unitarism is often manifested as a political doctrine or movement within complex political entities (confederations, federations, and other political unions), advocating for the highest degree of political integration and unification, beyond mere administrative centralization.One of the main goals of political unitarists (proponents of unitarism) is to abolish or substantially suppress all forms of regional self-government and autonomy, by transferring powers of confederated states, federal units, autonomous regions or cantons directly to the central government. Unitarization and regionalization are often confused with centralization and decentralization, respectively.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHistorically, complex processes of political unitarization were often accompanied by political struggle between proponents of unitarism and radical centralization, and their opponents, advocating decentralization and regionalism. In political history, that kind of political struggle was very frequent, even from ancient times. One of the most famous examples of local resistance to political unitarism in classical times was the internal conflict between ancient Athens and other federated city-states within the Delian League.\nIn modern history, one of the most notable examples of political unitarization was the creation of Kingdom of Great Britain by the Acts of Union in 1701, and subsequently the creation of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland by the Acts of Union in 1800.\nOne of practical goals of political unitarism is to create a singular legislature, with exclusive legislative powers over the entire territory of a state. Through the process of political unitarization, local regions within an emerging unitary state are deprived of any form of contract with the centralized government. Thus, the remaining regional powers, if any have been left at all, are not protected by being entrenched in the constitution of the unitary state; they can be reduced even more, or completely abolished, by the acts of the central government.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUnitary state\nCentralization\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhilip Camara (2016): Federalism's advantages over unitarism"

These Orders in Council had been the chosen method of implementation of Resolution 1373 and the directives of the 1267 Committee. The legislation was introduced in the House of Commons on 5 February 2010 and received royal assent on 10 February.\n\n\n== Judgment ==\nThe Act was passed following the HM Treasury v Ahmed ruling by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom on 27 January 2010 that asset-freezing orders made under the United Nations Act 1946 \u2013 specifically the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2009, the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006, the Al-Qa\u2019ida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2002, the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2001 and the Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 \u2013 were unlawful, because the 1946 Act was not intended to authorise coercive measures which interfere with fundamental rights without parliamentary scrutiny:\nThere was no indication during the [February 1946] debates at Second Reading in either House that it was envisaged that the Security Council would find it necessary under article 41 to require states to impose restraints or take coercive measures against their own citizens. The question whether it would be appropriate, if it were to do so, for the Government to be given power to introduce such measures by Orders in Council in the manner envisaged by the Bill was not discussed.\nMultiple persons, multiple orders and a forest of laws, Statutory Orders and UNSC resolutions were considered in the judgment. The applicants pleaded variously that the Treasury Orders were ultra vires for various reasons:\n\nillegality because it was passed without Parliamentary approval,\nlack of legal certainty and proportionality,\nthe absence of procedures that enabled designated persons to challenge their designation,\nby virtue of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 because they were incompatible with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and with article 1 of Protocol 1 of the ECHR,\nviolated client's right of access to a court for an effective remedy.Lord Phillips concluded that\n\nNobody should conclude that the result of these appeals constitutes judicial interference with the will of Parliament. On the contrary it upholds the supremacy of Parliament in deciding whether or not measures should be imposed that affect the fundamental rights of those in this country.\n\n\n== Legislation ==\nWhen the court refused to stay its judgement on 4 February, the 2010 Act was passed to retrospectively validate the orders until Parliament could pass new asset-freezing legislation which complied with the court's judgement.Speaking in the House of Commons on 8 February, Liberal Democrat MP David Heath said of the bill:\n\n[T]he legislation is before us because the Government have been found to be acting ultra vires and failing to secure proper parliamentary approval ... However, the arrogance of this Government and, in particular, the Treasury means that they do not understand what Parliament is for, and they do not understand the proper scrutiny of Bills.\n\n\n== Repeal ==\nThe Act was repealed by the Terrorist Asset-Freezing etc. Act 2010, a full legislative text with which to implement Resolution 1373.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTerrorism Acts\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 881/2002\nInterpol notice\nRules Publication Act 1893\nHani al-Sibai\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nExplanatory notes from the Office of Public Sector Information website\nBBC Democracy Live discussion on the Terrorist Asset-Freezing (Temporary Provisions) Act 2010"

"Punalur_Suspension_Bridge| Bridges in Kerala| Buildings and structures in Kollam district| 1877 establishments in India| Bridges completed in 1877| Suspension bridges in India| Transport in Kollam district| ","The Punalur Suspension Bridge, located in Punalur is the oldest motorable Bridge in Kerala, which was built by Travancore Government and is now a historical attraction. The bridge has a length of 400 feet (120 m). The suspension bridge was built to prevent wild animals from crossing into the town from the forest area of old Kattupathanapuram.\n\n\n== History and Construction ==\n \n\nThe Punalur Suspension Bridge is the first motorable bridge in South India. The suspension bridge crossing the river is the only suspended-deck type in south India. Built in 1877 by Albert Henry across the Kallada River, this huge bridge was suspended by two spans and was used for vehicular movement. Construction took more than six years. It is said that after completion of the bridge people hesitated to walk over the bridge. In order to prove the strength of the bridge the engineer and his family passed under the bridge in a country boat while six elephants were walking over it. Now the bridge is of historical interest and is a major tourist attraction.\n\n\n=== Reason for the construction ===\n\nThe main concept behind the construction of this bridge was that areas on the other side of the river Kallada was dense forests. A bridge was necessary. It was also built to prevent wild animals from getting to the populated side, a bridge which shakes when some one gets on it was built, this shaking scared off the animals and they wouldn't cross the bridge.\n\n\n=== Method of Construction ===\nThe bridge is connected to four wells. The iron rods of the bridge is connected to the clips, situated in the wells. Each well is about 100 feet deep and no one since knows the engineering behind the construction of this bridge. It still remains a mystery.\n\n\n== Replacement for the suspension bridge ==\nA new concrete bridge was built near to the Punalur Suspension Bridge in 1972 due to heavy traffic on the National Highway 208, a new strong bridge was built.\n\n\n== Renovation ==\n\nThe bridge was recently repaired and renovated by the government of Kerala. The structure was strengthened, new wood panels of the same tree (Kambakom) which was first used in the construction were fit, the steel armrests and the stone columns were painted, night lamps were installed and a new park and resting place were made near the bridge.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Punalur suspension bridge at Wikimedia Commons\n\nSketchUp Model of the Bridge"

Members of the family have included:\n\nJean-Baptiste van Rysselberghe (1820\u20131892) carpenter and entrepreneur.\nFran\u00e7ois van Rysselberghe (1846\u20131893), scientist and inventor, son of Jean-Baptiste.\nMax van Rysselberghe (1878\u20131952), engineer, son of Fran\u00e7ois.\nEnrique van Rysselberghe Mart\u00ednez (1911\u20131984), politician, mayor of Concepci\u00f3n, son of Max.\nEnrique van Rysselberghe Varela (1937\u20132013), architect, businessman and politician, son of Enrique.\nJacqueline van Rysselberghe (born 1965), surgeon and Chilean senator, daughter of Enrique Jr.\nEnrique van Rysselberghe Herrera (born 1976), engineer and Chilean senator, son of Enrique Jr.\nCharles van Rysselberghe (1850\u20131920), architect, son of Jean-Baptiste.\nJulien Marie van Rysselberghe (1852\u20131931), engineer and professor, son of Jean-Baptiste.\nOctave van Rysselberghe (1855\u20131929), architect, son of Jean-Baptiste.\nTh\u00e9o van Rysselberghe (1862\u20131926), painter, son of Jean-Baptiste.\n\u00c9lisabeth van Rysselberghe (1890\u20131980), translator, daughter of Th\u00e9o.\nCatherine Gide (1923\u20132013), daughter of \u00c9lisabeth.\n\n\n== The family ==\nThe Van Rysselberghe family is recorded as early as in the 17th century in Laarne, Flanders, where on 14 May 1695 Jacques van Rysselberghe married Andr\u00e9e Crabeels.Jean-Baptist van Rysselebrghe, a carpenter and wheelwright by trade, established himself in Ghent as an entrepreneur. He married M\u00e9lanie Rommens, with whom he had six children, including five sons, who would rise to fame as prominent artists and intellectuals. They were Fran\u00e7ois van Rysselberghe (1846 \u2013 1893), Charles van Rysselberghe (1850 \u2013 1920), Julien Marie van Rysselberghe (1852 \u2013 1931), Octave van Rysselberghe (1855 \u2013 1929), and Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe (1862 \u2013 1926).Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe was a prominent painter, who played a pivotal role in the European art scene at the turn of the twentieth century. After him, the most prominent member of the family is perhaps Fran\u00e7ois. He was a scientist and inventor, a forerunner and inventor of numerous devices in the fields of meteorology and telephony. Octave and Charles were both architects, whereas Julien Marie was an engineer of bridges and roads, as well as a professor of engineering at Ghent University. Jean-Baptist and M\u00e9lanie had also a daughter, Sylvia-Maria, who married a Chilean engineer.Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe married Maria Monnom from Brussels in 1889. Their daughter, \u00c9lisabeth van Rysselberghe, had a daughter, Catherine, with writer Andr\u00e9 Gide.Max van Rysselberghe, a son of Fran\u00e7ois, became engineer and embarked on a scientific expedition to Antarctica (the Belgian Antarctic Expedition) at the end of the 19th century, when he wasn't yet 20 years old. The expedition was supposed to last six months, but the ship became trapped in the ice and they were forced to winter in the Antarctic region, the first expedition to do so. The ice that blocked the ship didn't melt in the summer, so they decided to cut a channel to reach the open sea. Max van Rysselberghe used explosive to break the ice. Thus the presumed dead crew was able to return to Belgium after setting foot on Chile in Punta Arenas. Back in Belgium, Max van Rysselberghe met Isabel Mart\u00ednez, daughter of Chilean engineer Valent\u00edn Mart\u00ednez. In 1905, Van Rysselberghe went again to Chile. He took charge of several regulatory plans for towns near Santiago and Valpara\u00edso before settling in Concepci\u00f3n. He and Isabel had four children: Lidia, Ivonne, Enrique and Daniel. Enrique became director de obra in Concepci\u00f3n and later in life was elected regidor and then mayor of the city. He married Julieta Varela, by whom he had four children: Javier, Enrique, Ivonne and Astrid. Enrique Jr. became a deputy and married Mar\u00eda Norma Herrera. They had five children, the eldest of whom is Chilean surgeon and senator Jacqueline van Rysselberghe, while the penultimate is Chilean engineer and senator Enrique van Rysselberghe Herrera.The Chilean Van Rysselberghe live chiefly in Concepci\u00f3n, with some branches in Santiago and Linares.\n\n\n== References =="

"Mervyn_Williams_(artist)| Living people| 1940 births| New Zealand artists| People from Whakatāne| Elam Art School alumni| ","Mervyn John Williams  (born 22 April 1940) is a New Zealand artist. He was an early exponent of Op art in New Zealand in the 1960s\u201370s. In 1990 he originated a style of illusionary abstract painting based on chiaroscuro, creating the impression of three-dimensional forms and textures on a flat canvas. Since 2009 he has used digital techniques in returning to an Op art style. Williams is almost unique amongst his contemporaries in New Zealand art for having embraced abstraction at the start of his career and exclusively throughout. His work is held in all major New Zealand public collections. A monograph by Edward Hanfling was published by Ron Sang in 2014 coinciding with a survey exhibition.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWilliams was born in Whakat\u0101ne on 22 April 1940. He moved between the Bay of Plenty Region and Auckland between 1940 and 1951 when he settled permanently in Auckland. He began secondary school at Avondale College in 1954, where his art teacher was Robert Nettleton Field. In 1956, Williams was obliged to leave school prematurely to help support his family following the death of his father, though Field continued to mentor his former student.In 1955, Williams began work at ceramics firm Crown Lynn, where he received guidance and encouragement from Frank Carpay. He subsequently pursued a more intensive design opportunity at Ted Dutch's art and design studio, receiving training in painting, design and graphic techniques until 1961 when he established his own studio. In 1957 and 1958, Williams attended Elam School of Fine Arts part-time, where he met Don Binney and Graham Percy.Williams married Helen Jermyn in 1962. They had three sons, and from 1965 to 1972 lived near Te Henga (Bethells Beach), in West Auckland. The couple divorced in 1985. In the mid-1960s, photographer Marti Friedlander made a series of portraits of Williams.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early work ===\nWilliams made oil paintings as well as works in gouache on paper during the years 1956 to 1961. They feature adjacent and layered patches of mainly muted colour along with linear elements. There are similarities to the paintings of Ted Dutch and to mid-twentieth-century School of Paris abstract painters, such as Vieira da Silva and Georges Mathieu. Beginning in the early 1960s, Williams began to make work with strong geometric shapes influenced by Josef Albers and Mark Rothko.\n\n\n=== Op art ===\n\nIn the early to mid 1960s, Williams began working in the Op art style that developed over the same period in Europe and the United States. His compositions of closely spaced lines, geometric shapes and high-keyed, contrasting colours were carefully rendered to create optical illusions and vibrations. He aimed to create the impression of movement and three-dimensionality on a static, two-dimensional painted surface, and to bring the experience of visual art closer to that of music, unfolding over time. The Chromatic Invention series (1969\u201370) reflects the artist's admiration of Johann Sebastian Bach, and his belief that invention is the most important quality in art.Williams' work of the 1960s and 1970s relates to that of European artists such as Bridget Riley and Victor Vasarely. Op art came to prominence in the United States with the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s exhibition The Responsive Eye in 1965, and had a large public following. In New Zealand, a small number of artists worked in an Op style, notably Gordon Walters and Ray Thorburn. Williams and Walters travelled to Melbourne, Australia, together in 1975, breaking their return journey to visit Sydney to see an exhibition of recent paintings by Bridget Riley at the Coventry Gallery.Williams\u2019 Op art was partly a reaction against the emphasis on expressive mark-making and individual style in 1950s Abstract Expressionism. He believed in the universal appeal of optical illusion, declaring that it \u201cappeals to a more innocent side of ourselves\u201d. He experimented with photo-mechanical techniques to produce optical patterns as efficiently as possible and in multiples, thereby making it available to more people. The exactitude and impersonal finish of Williams\u2019 paintings directs the viewer\u2019s attention to the images themselves and their own perception, rather than the artist\u2019s touch or sensibility.Important series from Williams\u2019 Op art phase of the 1970s include the Daedal series, the Quotient (1973) and Delta (1978\u201380) series. These series were shown during the 1970s at Barry Lett Galleries in Auckland and the Elva Bett Gallery in Wellington. A selection from all three series was shown in a two-person exhibition with Gordon Walters at the Canterbury Society of Arts Gallery in 1984.\n\n\n=== Crusties ===\nIn 1980 Williams visited New York and London, and saw the exhibition A New Spirit in Painting at the Royal Academy, London, and other important exhibitions in New York, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. Upon his return he began to make paintings with thickly encrusted paint and simpler compositions. However, the interest in perception continued, as the raised paint surfaces and layering of colours generated a play of light and shadow.Williams was part of the Seven Painters/The Eighties exhibition that toured New Zealand during 1982\u201383, starting at the Sarjeant Gallery in Whanganui. The exhibition also featured Gretchen Albrecht, Stephen Bambury, Max Gimblett, Richard Killeen, James Ross, and Ian Scott. In 1983, Williams was included in the exhibition The Grid: Lattice and Network at the Auckland City Art Gallery.In the second half of the 1980s, Williams continued his quest to \u201carticulate light\u201d, using gels and pastes to produce a concrete or tactile support that he then sprayed with thin films of paint. Paintings such as Chart (1989) and Desert Sand (1986) generate changing effects of light and colour that depend on the conditions under which they are seen and the position of the viewer.Williams\u2019 paintings of this period have similarities with the 1970s \u201cthick field\u201d abstract paintings of American artists Jules Olitski and Larry Poons. However, art historian Michael Dunn contrasts Williams\u2019 interest in light and illusion with the emphasis on flatness and objecthood in American abstraction.\n\n\n=== Wooden constructions ===\n\nIn 1989, Williams was awarded the Tylee Cottage Residency in Whanganui, a position administered by the Sarjeant Gallery Te Whare o Rehua, and he continued to live in Whanganui until 1991. He collected wooden detritus washed down the Whanganui River from beaches around the river mouth, and with the aid of a local joiner created subtle geometric compositions. Williams was attracted to the natural textures, tones and patterns of the weathered wood, and he has said that their \u201csurfaces had an eloquence about them that had evolved spontaneously, rather than been laboured over with modelling paste.\u201d Notable examples are Odyssey (1989, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o T\u0101maki) and Organon 1 (1989, Sarjeant Gallery Te Whare o Rehua).\nThe wooden constructions were exhibited at Gow Langsford Gallery, Auckland, in July\u2013August 1989, and later that year under the title Points of Departure at the Sarjeant Gallery, where Williams also made a large sculptural installation in the central domed space.\n\n\n=== Illusionary paintings ===\n\nDuring 1990\u201391, while living in Whanganui, Williams worked on techniques for creating the illusion of physical texture on a flat, painted surface. Eventually, using a thin film of paint and creating fine shifts in tone and colour, he achieved an almost photographic rendering of effects of light and shadow. The series evolved as a number of distinct formats or groups, each based on a simple, geometric structure. The paintings are primarily studies in perception and light. Williams has been likened to a \u201cmagician\u201d because his paintings generate responses of surprise and wonder, and a degree of mystery surrounds his technique. The illusionary paintings are considered an original achievement, without obvious precedent in the history of art internationally. They were first exhibited at Gow Langsford Gallery in March 1992, following Williams\u2019 return to Auckland the previous year.\nThe illusionary paintings are representational in the manner of the Old Masters, and can thus be described accurately as trompe-l'\u0153il works, but they represent abstract forms and ambiguous phenomena. Williams has described them as \u201cat once both totally abstract and as representational as you can get.\u201d According to curator Anna-Marie White, Williams is significant because \u201che created a new direction within abstract painting while simultaneously challenging the very nature of abstraction as a non-representational art form.\u201d Important examples of the illusionary paintings are Where Corals Lie (1994, Rutherford Collection) and Precept (Gold) (2005, private collection).\nThe illusionary paintings draw attention to perception itself, and encourage critical reflection on the relationship between what we see and what we believe we see.\n\n\n=== Digital mixed media paintings ===\n\nWilliams began to experiment with digital techniques in 2009, leading him to revisit his Op style of the 1960s and 1970s. He developed a new body of work combining digital processes with traditional painting techniques. Works such as Solar Flare (2011), Centrifuge (2013) and Paragon (2013) create optical vibrations that would have been difficult to achieve before the advent of digital technology. Parallels have been drawn between Williams' attitude to digital technology and the spirit of excitement, hope and innovation that informed his original Op works in the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Sculpture ===\nWilliams has produced sculpture throughout his career, though it was only during his time in Whanganui that it came to the fore. In 2007 he began to devote more time to sculpture, and produced a series of works using tubular modules in bronze, stainless steel, aluminium and concrete, realising them on an increasingly large scale.\n\n\n== Major exhibitions ==\n2015 Fa\u00e7ade, ARTIS Gallery, Auckland\n2014 Lost for Words: Mervyn Williams: From Modernism to the Digital Age, Gus Fisher Gallery, Auckland\n2008 Sleight of Hand, Suter Art Gallery, Nelson\n2000 Opposites Attract, with Paul Dibble, Michael Carr Art Dealer, Sydney\n1997 Ross Bleckner, Mark Francis, Mervyn Williams, Gow Langsford Gallery, Auckland\n1996 Visa Gold Award, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o T\u0101maki\n1994 Parallel Lines: Gordon Walters in Context, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o T\u0101maki\n1992 Surface Tension, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o T\u0101maki\n1990 Out of the Woods, Sarjeant Gallery Te Whare o Rehua Whanganui\n1989 Points of Departure, Sarjeant Gallery Te Whare o Rehua Whanganui\n1984 Gordon Walters and Mervyn Williams, Canterbury Society of Arts Gallery, Christchurch\n1983 Aspects of Recent New Zealand Art: The Grid: Lattice and Network, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o T\u0101maki\n1982 Seven Painters/The Eighties, Sarjeant Gallery Te Whare o Rehua Whanganui, touring exhibition\n1980 Benson and Hedges Art Award Exhibition\n1978 Auckland Painters Exhibition, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o T\u0101maki\n1972 Biennale of Graphic Art, Paris\n1970 NZ Pavilion, Expo 70, Japan\n1967 Two-person exhibition with Pat Hanly, Wellington\n1966 International Biennale of Graphic Art, Tokyo\n\n\n== Collections ==\nAuckland Art Gallery Toi o T\u0101maki\nChartwell Collection, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o T\u0101maki\nChristchurch Art Gallery Te Puna o Waiwhetu\nDunedin Public Art Gallery\nMuseum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa\nSarjeant Gallery Te Whare o Rehua, Whanganui\nSuter Art Gallery, Nelson\nTe Manawa Art Gallery, Palmerston North\nUniversity of Auckland\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="

"Alexander_of_Lincoln| 1148 deaths| 12th-century English people| 12th-century English Roman Catholic bishops| Bishops of Lincoln| History of Lincolnshire| People from Blois| ","Alexander of Lincoln (died February 1148) was a medieval English Bishop of Lincoln, a member of an important administrative and ecclesiastical family. He was the nephew of Roger of Salisbury, a Bishop of Salisbury and Chancellor of England under King Henry I, and he was also related to Nigel, Bishop of Ely. Educated at Laon, Alexander served in his uncle's diocese as an archdeacon in the early 1120s. Unlike his relatives, he held no office in the government before his appointment as Bishop of Lincoln in 1123. Alexander became a frequent visitor to King Henry's court after his appointment to the episcopate, often witnessing royal documents, and he served as a royal justice in Lincolnshire.\nAlthough Alexander was known for his ostentatious and luxurious lifestyle, he founded a number of religious houses in his diocese and was an active builder and literary patron. He also attended church councils and reorganised his diocese by increasing the number of archdeaconries and setting up prebends to support his cathedral clergy. Under Henry's successor, King Stephen, Alexander was caught up in the fall from favour of his family, and was imprisoned together with his uncle Roger in 1139. He subsequently briefly supported Stephen's rival, Matilda, but by the late 1140s Alexander was once again working with Stephen. He spent much of the late 1140s at the papal court in Rome, but died in England in early 1148. During his episcopate he began the rebuilding of his cathedral, which had been destroyed by fire. Alexander was the patron of medieval chroniclers Henry of Huntingdon and Geoffrey of Monmouth, and also served as an ecclesiastical patron of the medieval hermit Christina of Markyate and Gilbert of Sempringham, founder of the Gilbertines.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nAlexander was a nephew of Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, probably the son of Roger's brother Humphrey. His mother's name, Ada, is known from the Lincoln Cathedral libri memoriales, or obituary books. Alexander's brother David was archdeacon of Buckingham in the diocese of Lincoln. Other relatives included Nigel, another nephew of Roger's; and Adelelm, later Treasurer of England, who was recorded as Roger's nephew but perhaps was his son. It is possible, although unproven, that Nigel was really Alexander's brother rather than his cousin. Roger's son Roger le Poer, who later became Chancellor of England, was also a cousin. Alexander's cousin Nigel had a son, Richard FitzNeal, who later became Treasurer of England and Bishop of London. Alexander also had a nephew William, who became an archdeacon, and a great-nephew named Robert de Alvers.Alexander's birthdate is unknown. Together with his cousin Nigel he was educated at Laon, under the schoolmaster Anselm of Laon, and returned to England at some unknown date. The historian Martin Brett feels that Alexander probably served as a royal chaplain early in his career, although no sources support this conjecture. Alexander was an archdeacon in the diocese of Salisbury by 1121, under his uncle. While occupying that office he was credited with writing a glossary of Old English legal terms in the Anglo Norman language, entitled the Expositiones Vocabulorum. Unlike his cousin Nigel, Alexander does not appear to have entered the king's household or administration before his appointment as a bishop, and only attested, or witnessed, one royal charter before his appointment to the episcopate in 1123.\n\n\n== Bishop ==\nAlexander was nominated to the see of Lincoln in April 1123 and was consecrated bishop on 22 July 1123, at a ceremony held in Canterbury. He owed his appointment to his uncle's influence with King Henry I; the Peterborough version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle noted that Alexander's appointment to the episcopate was done entirely for the love of Roger.During his time as bishop Alexander secured the submission of St Albans Abbey to his diocese and founded a number of monasteries, including Haverholme Priory (a Gilbertine house), Dorchester on Thames (an Arrouaisian Order house), Louth Park, and Thame; Louth was one of the first Cistercian houses founded in England, and Dorchester was the refoundation of a former collegiate church. During Alexander's episcopate 13 Cistercian abbeys and seven nunneries were founded in his diocese. Alexander himself consecrated the church at Markyate used by the medieval mystic Christina of Markyate and her nuns, and it was he who consecrated her as a hermit at St Albans Abbey. Alexander also founded a hospital for lepers at Newark-on-Trent.Although Alexander was a frequent witness to royal charters and documents, there is no evidence that he held an official government position after his appointment as bishop, unlike his relatives Roger and Nigel. Nevertheless, Alexander subsequently appears to have become a regular presence at the royal court. He frequently attested royal charters after 1123, and probably acted as a royal justice in Lincolnshire and the town of Lincoln. He also held the royal castles at Newark, Sleaford and Banbury, and gave confirmations of grants to the church at Godstow.Alexander was probably at the 1125 church council held at Westminster by the papal legate John of Crema, and shortly afterwards accompanied the legate on his journey back to Rome. He was still in Rome in 1126, and may have helped to obtain a papal confirmation of his uncle's possession of Malmesbury Abbey, Abbotsbury Abbey, and Horton. At some point during his episcopate, an eighth archdeaconry was established in his diocese, for the West Riding area of Lindsey. Besides these reorganisations, Alexander had a number of clerics in his personal household, including Gilbert of Sempringham, who later founded the Gilbertine order. Other members of the bishop's household were Ralph Gubion, who became abbot of St Albans, and an Italian Bible scholar named Guido or Wido, who taught that subject while serving Alexander.Alexander presided over the organisation of his diocese into prebends to support the cathedral clergy; he established at least one new prebend and augmented two others. He also attended the church councils in 1127 and 1129 that were convened by William de Corbeil, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Later, during 1133 and 1134, he and the archbishop quarrelled, but the exact nature of their dispute is unknown. William and Alexander travelled to Normandy in 1134 to seek out King Henry to settle their dispute.\n\n\n== Reign of Stephen ==\n\nAfter Henry's death in 1135 the succession was disputed between the king's nephews\u2014Stephen and his elder brother Theobald II, Count of Champagne\u2014and Henry's surviving legitimate child Matilda, usually known as the Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V. King Henry's only legitimate son, William, had died in 1120. After Matilda was widowed in 1125 she returned to her father, who married her to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry's heir, but after Henry I's death in 1135 Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned, before Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. But Matilda was less sanguine and secured the support of the Scottish king, David, her maternal uncle, and in 1138 that of her half-brother, Robert, Earl of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of Henry I.The election of Theobald of Bec to the Archbishopric of Canterbury was announced at the Council of Westminster in 1138. The medieval chronicler Gervase of Canterbury writes that 17 bishops attended the council, which implies that Alexander was present. After a failed expedition to Normandy in 1137, the influence of Alexander's uncle, Roger of Salisbury, waned at the court of King Stephen, but the king took no action against the family that might incite them to rebel. In early 1139 Stephen may have named William d'Aubigny as Earl of Lincoln, perhaps in an effort to limit Alexander's influence in Lincolnshire.In June 1139 a knight was killed during a fight in Oxford between a party of Roger of Salisbury's men and a group of noblemen. The king ordered Roger to attend his court to explain the circumstances of the incident and to surrender custody of his castles, which Roger refused to do, resulting in his and Alexander's arrest; Roger's other nephew, Nigel, evaded capture. Another possible explanation for the arrests is offered by the Gesta Stephani, a contemporary chronicle, which reported the king's fear that Roger and his nephews were plotting to hand their castles to the Empress Matilda. Stephen may alternatively have been attempting to assert his rights over the castles, and demonstrate his authority over powerful subjects. Alexander was imprisoned in Oxford, in conditions described by some medieval chroniclers as bad.Since the work of Henry of Huntingdon, who wrote in the years before 1154 and who regarded Stephen's actions as treachery against the clergy that earned him punishment from God, Alexander's arrest has been seen by many historians as a turning point in Stephen's reign. Writing in the 1870s, the historian William Stubbs felt that the arrest destroyed the royal administration, but modern historians have advanced differing explanations for the troubles that followed, not all of which are related to the bishop's arrest.After Roger and Alexander's arrests Nigel defied the king. The bishops' castles refused to surrender to the king, therefore Stephen threatened to starve Alexander and Roger until they did. Sleaford and Newark surrendered and were given into the custody of Robert, the Earl of Leicester. Earl Robert also seized some of Lincoln's episcopal estates that had been disputed between the earl and the bishop. Alexander subsequently excommunicated Earl Robert when the earl refused to return the castle to Alexander's custody. Alexander then successfully applied to Pope Innocent II in 1139 for support in his efforts to recover Newark castle from Earl Robert.Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester and one of the king's main supporters, had recently been appointed papal legate. Henry objected to Stephen's actions in arresting the bishops and confiscating their property, as they were in contravention of canon law. Henry called a legatine council, a church council convened by a papal legate, at Winchester to discuss the issue, which ended in nothing being done, although both sides threatened excommunication and stated they would appeal to Rome and the papacy for support. Alexander did not attend the council of Winchester, but his uncle did. He seems to have borne Stephen no ill will over the arrest, and worked with the king during Stephen's later reign.In 1141 Alexander and the citizens of the town of Lincoln requested that Stephen come to Lincoln and intercede with Ranulf de Gernon, the Earl of Chester, who was attempting to enforce what he regarded as his rights to Lincoln Castle. Stephen arrived and besieged Ranulf's wife and half-brother in the castle, but the earl escaped and sought aid from Robert of Gloucester, Matilda's half-brother and leading supporter. Following Robert's arrival in Lincoln a battle took place there on 2 February 1141, during which Stephen was captured by Matilda's forces. Alexander was present at Oxford in July 1141, when the Empress Matilda held court and attempted to consolidate her hold on England. The citizens of London objected to Matilda's rule when she arrived in their city, and drove her away; Robert of Gloucester was captured shortly afterwards. This reversal of the Empress' fortunes resulted in Stephen's release, after he was exchanged for Robert. The next few years, until 1148, saw a period of civil war in England, often called The Anarchy, when neither Matilda nor Stephen controlled the country.\n\n\n== Patronage ==\n\nAlexander was a supporter of Gilbert of Sempringham's new monastic order of the Gilbertines, and he was also known as a patron of literature. He commissioned Geoffrey of Monmouth to compose the Prophecies of Merlin, which Geoffrey dedicated to him. Alexander was a patron of the medieval chronicler Henry of Huntingdon, and requested that Henry write his historical work.Alexander rebuilt Lincoln Cathedral after it had been destroyed by fire at an unknown date. He had the roof done with stone vaulting and began construction of the west front of the cathedral, which was finished under his successor. The only remaining major traces of Alexander's work on the west end are the carved doors and the frieze on the west front. The author of the Gesta Stephani claimed that Alexander's additions made Lincoln Cathedral \"

They were the brothers of the Bahila tribe. Throughout their history, they were a relatively small tribe compared to the other subtribes of Qays.\n\n\n=== Pre-Islamic era ===\nIn the mid-6th century a leader of the Banu Ghani, Riyah ibn Ashall, killed the son of the powerful chieftain of the Banu Abs, Zuhayr ibn Jadhima. His daughter was later wed to the founder of the paramount clan of the Banu 'Amir, Ja\u2019far ibn Kilab. From then onward, the Banu Ghani acted as subordinate allies of the Banu Amir, victoriously fighting alongside them at the battle of Shi\u2019b in 580 and the battle of Raqam toward the close of the century. However, they suffered heavy casualties alongside the Banu 'Amir subtribes of Banu Kilab and Banu Ka'b at the hands of the Banu Tayy at the battle of Muhajjar in the early 7th century. They later retaliated against the Tayy.\n\n\n=== Islamic era ===\nThough one member of the tribe, Abu Marthad al-Ghanawi, was an early companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, most of the tribe converted after the defeat of the pagan Arab tribes at the Battle of Hunayn in 630. They remained Muslim when many of the converted Arab tribes apostatized during the Ridda wars following Muhammad's death in 632. Many Ghani tribesmen migrated to Syria during the Muslim conquest of the region between 634 and 638. Following the rout of the Qaysi tribes at the Battle of Marj Rahit in 684, the Qaysi\u2013Yamani wars ensued. During the long-running conflict, the Banu Ghani fought alongside their Qaysi kinsmen against the Yamani tribes and the Taghlib.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nF\u00fcck, J. W.

A spacecraft launched as part of the Venera programme, Kosmos 167 was intended to land on Venus but never departed low Earth orbit due to a launch failure.\nBeginning in 1962, the name Kosmos was given to Soviet spacecraft which remained in Earth orbit, regardless of whether that was their intended final destination. The designation of this mission as an intended planetary probe is based on evidence from Soviet and non-Soviet sources and historical documents. Typically, Soviet planetary missions were initially put into an Earth parking orbit as a launch platform with a rocket engine and attached probe. The probes were then launched toward their targets with an engine burn with a duration of roughly 4 minutes. If the engine misfired or the burn was not completed, the probes would be left in Earth orbit and given a Kosmos designation.\n\n\n== Spacecraft ==\nThe 4V-1 No.311 spacecraft was the second of two 4V-1 vehicles built and operated by GSMZ Lavochkin, following Venera 4.\n\n\n== Mission ==\nA Molniya-M carrier rocket was used to launch the spacecraft. The launch occurred from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 02:36:38 GMT on 17 June 1967. This mission was intended to be a Venus lander, similar in design to the Venera 4 spacecraft. The spacecraft became stranded in Earth orbit when its Blok VL, fourth stage (trans-interplanetary stage), failed to fire because the engine's turbopump had not been cooled prior to ignition, never departed its parking orbit, and was designated Kosmos 167. The spacecraft reentered on 25 June 1967. It was deployed into a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 187 kilometres (116 mi), an apogee of 286 kilometres (178 mi), an inclination of 51.8\u00b0 to the equator, and orbital period of 89.2 minutes. It would have received the next designation in the Venera series, at the time Venera 5.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of missions to Venus\n\n\n== References =="

"Richard_Commission| Senedd| ","The Commission on the Powers and Electoral Arrangements of the National Assembly for Wales, known unofficially as The Richard Commission, was established in July 2002 by the First Minister of the National Assembly for Wales, now known as the Senedd. Ivor Richard, Baron Richard was appointed to chair the Commission. Richard was joined by five Commissioners appointed following open competition and interview, as well as four commissioners nominated jointly by the four party leaders in the first Assembly.The purpose of the Commission was examine the powers and electoral arrangements of the National Assembly and to remit its findings in an independent report. The report was intended to contribute to decisions on the future of the National Assembly and the way Wales was to be governed.The Commission published its report in March 2004. It recommended that the National Assembly should have powers to legislate in certain areas, whilst others would remain the preserve of Westminster. It also recommended changing the electoral system to the single transferable vote (STV) which would produce greater proportionality.\nThe Commission did not evaluate the performance of the Assembly or the Welsh Assembly Government. The Commission viewed that would have involved going outside the terms of reference and making subjective judgments.\nIn response, the British government, in its Better Governance for Wales White Paper, published on 15 June 2005, proposed a more permissive law-making system for the Welsh Assembly based on the use of Parliamentary Orders in Council. In so doing, the Government rejected many of the cross party Richard Commission's recommendations. This has attracted criticism from opposition parties and others.\n\n\n== Commission's membership ==\nIvor Richard, Baron Richard, previously Leader of the House of Lords, EEC Commissioner, Member of Parliament and UK Ambassador to the United Nations.\nTom Jones, farmer from Welshpool, Powys.

The newspaper, owned by Chen Fan and edited by Zhang Shizhao of the Patriotic Study Society, was being published in January 1900. It advocated reform and radicalism and supported the Patriotic Academy. Su Bao was closed down by the authorities in 1903.\n\n\n== Suppression ==\nIn the summer of 1903, Su Bao was suppressed. It had published a series of articles about overthrowing the monarchy and realizing republicanism. At that time the pioneer of democratic revolution minister, Zou Rong, published Revolutionary Army. Su Bao not only published the description of Revolutionary Army written by Zou Rong, the Preface of Revolutionary Army, written by Zhang Binglin, and Introduction of Revolution Army, written by Zhang Shizhao, but also spoke highly of them. \nOn June 29, Su Bao published another article, The Relationship between Kang Youwei and Sir Jue Luo, which not only opposed Kang Youwei for his opinion of supporting constitution and refusing revolution, but also challenged Emperor Guangxu and Empress Dowager Cixi. On the same day that the article was published, foreign concession government arrested Zhang Binglin and Zou Rong, and then closed down the newspaper. The Qing government was urged to execute Zhang Binglin and Zou Rong. However, because of huge social pressure, the concession areas sentenced them to life imprisonment in their first trial. Afterwards the authorities were forced to change the sentence of Zhang Binglin to three years and that of Zou Rong to two years.\n\n\n== Significance ==\nThe case is memorable in Chinese newspaper history. The feudal class never allowed speeches of offence to governors in order to maintain authoritarian rules. They used literary inquisition as their weapon to control those who dared to say something, especially in Qing and Ming Dynasty. Since modern times when newspapers came into being, rulers were trying to suppress and control them. Su Bao case showed a conflict between feudal rulers and modern progressive thought, and may be the oldest and most typical literary inquisition in the press during the history of China.\n\n\n== References =="

Ibn Daud wrote:\n\nThen King Charles sent to the King of Baghdad [Caliph] requesting that he dispatch one of his Jews of the seed of royalty of the House of David. He hearkened and sent him one from there, a magnate and sage, Rabbi Makhir by name. And [Charles] settled him in Narbonne, the capital city, and planted him there, and gave him a great possession there at the time he captured it from the Ishmaelites [Arabs]. And he [Makhir] took to wife a woman from among the magnates of the town; *...* and the King made him a nobleman and designed, out of love for [Makhir], good statutes for the benefit of all the Jews dwelling in the city, as is written and sealed in a Latin charter; and the seal of the King therein [bears] his name Carolus; and it is in their possession at the present time. The Prince Makhir became chieftain there. He and his descendants were close [inter-related] with the King and all his descendants.Whatever Makhir's Babylon origins claimed by his descendants, the relation between Makhir and Charlemagne is legendary, the more famous king substituting for his father Pepin, king of the Franks, who in order to enlist the Jews of Narbonne in his efforts to keep the Ummayad Saracens at bay, granted wide-ranging powers in return for the surrender of Moorish Narbonne to him in 759. The Annals of Aniane and the Chronicle of Moissac both attribute this action to the Gothic leaders of Narbonne, rising up and massacring the Saracen garrison. Pepin with his sons Carloman and Charles redeemed this pledge in 768, granting to Makhir and his heirs extensive lands, an act that called forth an unavailing protest from Pope Stephen III. In 791 Charlemagne confirmed the status of the Jewish Principate and made the title of Nasi permanent.The Makhir family enjoyed for centuries many privileges and that its members bore the title of \"

"Exclaustration| Organisation of Catholic religious orders| Catholic canon law of religious| ","In the canon law of the Catholic Church, exclaustration is the official authorization for a member of a religious order (in short, a religious) bound by perpetual vows to live for a limited time outside their religious institute, usually with a view to discerning whether to depart definitively.\n\n\n== Distinctions ==\nExclaustration is distinguished from permission to live outside of a religious community for purposes such as caring for a parent or for reasons of work or study. The religious who in such circumstances is forced to be absent physically does not wish to separate even temporarily from the institute.Exclaustration is distinguished also from dispensation from religious vows. The exclaustrated religious remains a religious and remains bound by those vows, although the manner of exercising poverty and obedience is altered in view of the changed circumstances.A religious bound by temporary vows may for a grave reason be authorized to leave before expiry of the period for which the vows were taken. This authorization is called an indult of departure, not an exclaustration. Unless the religious rejects it, an indult of departure entails dispensation from the religious vows that have been taken.\n\n\n== Clergy ==\nIf the religious who is to be exclaustrated is a deacon or priest, he must first obtain the consent of the local ordinary (diocesan bishop or the equivalent in law of a diocesan bishop, such as an apostolic prefect) of the place where he intends to reside. Such residence may serve as a first step towards incardination into the jurisdiction of the ordinary. Agreement must be made with the local ordinary about any exercise of sacred ministry by the religious during the period of exclaustration.\n\n\n=== Experimental and qualified exclaustration ===\nIn addition to ordinary or simple exclaustration, as described above, the Holy See, but not the religious superior or the diocesan bishop, may grant what has been called an exclaustration ad experimentum to a religious priest who has definitively decided to leave his institute and become a diocesan priest and who has found a diocesan bishop willing to accept him on a trial basis. This has the additional effect that he will be automatically released from his religious vows and incardinated into the diocese when the bishop decides to accept him definitively or, provided the bishop has not rejected him before then, at the close of a five-year trial period.If a diocesan bishop is willing to incardinate a religious priest immediately, there is no need for exclaustration, and secularization (dispensation from the religious vows) is granted instead.In certain situations where a religious priest does not intend to become a diocesan priest, the Holy See has sometimes granted what has been called \"

According to the contemporary chronicles, Malatesta designed it, although it is known that several architects worked on the construction, including Filippo Brunelleschi, who visited Rimini for two months in 1438. Construction lasted some 15 years.\nThe castle-palace originally was surrounded by a large moat, with a ravelin at the main entrance, sporting the heraldic symbols of the House of Malatesta. The walls were thought to be thick enough to bear the impact of the new artillery pieces of that period. Although originally positioned externally from the city, it has no towers facing that side: all towers are in fact oriented towards the city. These towers are square, and once housed a bronze cannon each.\nThe central part of the castle was also the Malatesta residence, with rooms decorated with tapestries, curtains and frescoes. Also the exterior was decorated, as suggested by the few maiolica tiles visible. Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta died here in 1468.\nIn 1821 the castle was turned into barracks for the local Carabinieri. Five years later, the external walls were demolished and the moat filled. After a period of decline, the edifice is now used for cultural exhibitions.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPage at www.riminiturismo.it (in Italian and English)"

Williams), but no printed libretto, is found in British Library.  The score contains all the dialogue.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWhen the Gilbert and Sullivan partnership disbanded after the production of The Gondoliers in 1889, the impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte filled the Savoy Theatre with a combination of new works and revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.  The fashion in the late Victorian era was to present long evenings in the theatre, and so producer Richard D'Oyly Carte preceded his Savoy operas with curtain raisers.  W. J. MacQueen-Pope commented, concerning such curtain raisers:\n\nThis was a one-act play, seen only by the early comers.  It would play to empty boxes, half-empty upper circle, to a gradually filling stalls and dress circle, but to an attentive, grateful and appreciative pit and gallery.  Often these plays were little gems.  They deserved much better treatment than they got, but those who saw them delighted in them. ...  [They] served to give young actors and actresses a chance to win their spurs ... the stalls and the boxes lost much by missing the curtain-raiser, but to them dinner was more important.To create Old Sarah, Carte selected two artists who he knew could deliver a good piece.  Cellier was the long-time music director of the Savoy Theatre and had produced other works for Carte.  Greenbank was also a known quantity, first for having supplied the theatre with two other curtain raisers, Captain Billy (1891) and Mr. Jericho (1893).  In addition, by this time, Greenbank's reputation was well established, having supplied lyrics for a number of hit musicals, including A Gaiety Girl (1893), An Artist's Model (1895), The Geisha (1896), and The Circus Girl (1896).\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIn Dullport, a dreary seaside town, out of season, Old Sarah sells sweets from a stall.

"Leiper_Railroad| Railway lines opened in 1810| Horse-drawn railways| Railway lines closed in 1828| Companies based in Philadelphia| Defunct Pennsylvania railroads| ","The Leiper Railroad was a 'family business built' horse drawn railroad of three quarters of a mile constructed in 1810 after the quarry owner, Thomas Leiper, failed to obtain a charter with legal rights-of-way to instead build his desired canal along Crum Creek.  The quarry man's 'make-do' railroad was the continent's first chartered railway, first operational non-temporary railway, first well-documented railroad, and first constructed railroad also meant to be permanent.\n\nThe credit of constructing the first permanent tramway in America may therefore be rightly given to Thomas Leiper. He was the owner of a fine quarry not far from Philadelphia, and was much concerned to find an easy mode of carrying stone to tide-water. That a railway would accomplish this end he seem to have had no doubt. To test the matter, and at the same time afford a public exhibition of the merits of tramways, he built a temporary track in the yard of the Bull's Head Tavern in Philadelphia. The tramway was some sixty feet long, had a grade of one inch and a half to the yard, and up it, to the amazement of the spectators, one horse used to draw a four-wheeled wagon loaded with a weight of ten thousand pounds. This was the summer of 1809. Before autumn laborers were at work building a railway from the quarry to the nearest landing, a distance of three quarters of a mile. In the spring of 1810 the road began to be used and continued in using during eighteen years. by John Bach McMaster, page 494, A History of the People of the United States, from the Revolution to the Civil War\n\n\n== Leiper ==\nThomas Leiper was a Pennsylvania Militia officer who served during several campaign years, first failing to obtain allowance to build a canal connecting his quarry near Crum Creek to Ridley Creek, reaching flood-waters on the estuary of the Delaware Valley tidewater in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. \nFirst, he commissioned a short experimental horse-powered railway in 1809 which proved a horse-drawn heavy wagon heavily loaded could advance successfully against a stiff gradient a bit over 4%. The track, with a 4 feet (1.2 m) gauge, had a grade of 1-1/2 inch to the yard (1 : 24 or about 4%) over its total length of 60 yards (54.9 m) and proves satisfactory when tested with a loaded car.  The test track had created quite a scene, so it and the railway begun that year was both studied by nearby Penn students and professors, and was much covered in the press \u2014 when the permanent railroad began operations, it was on every-day operational display in the nation's largest, and most industrialized city.  \nIt operated regularly as a private carrier between 1810 and 1828 in what is now Nether Providence Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, a short distance away from the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) within Philadelphia itself, so the railroad became the first 'meant to be permanent' and documented railway in North America, and first built by civilians.  Ironically, when an 1824 petition finally succeeded, the railroad was replaced by the 'long desired canal' just as the world elsewhere was turning to and regularly were considering adopting railways for movement of heavy and bulk goods, as well as people. Then, in 1852, the railway was reopened and it replaced in turn, the Leiper Canal.\n\n\n== Historical context ==\nIn the 1930s, a Harvard economics study observed that post Revolutionary War towns throughout the country experienced phenomenal growth rates, citing 133% per decade as a sustained average growth rate, that continued into the 1920s.  This means, for every 1000 citizens, ten years later there were 2330 by the decade's end. \nFrom the start of the 1880s, most of the well known, or the individuals commonly thought of as our country's founding fathers, as well as many lesser known men of means and affairs had focused on transportation as being a problem. The 13 colonies had saturated the riverine valleys so far as they would support agrarian life-styles in vogue for the times, and industry was building only slowly but blocked by lack of fuels and worse, lack of means to transport it the tens or hundreds of miles it need come if a foundry or mill were to make use of it.\nHence, after the mid-1780s, the historical record shows repeated petitions to allow river improvements or charters for turnpikes and toll roads, so historians can correctly paint the era as either the canal age or the turnpike age.  In 1793, the engineers of the Middlesex Canal, located a hydraulic cement and generally showed the way forward, and for the next several decades, canals to support commerce such as the Delaware and Hudson Canal, the Potomack Canal, the Raritan, the Morris, or the more famous Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, Lehigh Canal, Schuylkill Canal and Erie Canal & Illinois Canals all cheapened long distance shipping, spurred commerce, and enabled the industrial revolution, including the production of enough iron to make railroads to create their own assassins.\nAs the Leiper Canal was being constructed, a number of other railroad projects of far more ambitious scope were taking the field:\n\nPennsylvania's second charter was included in the Main Line of Public Works legislation, authorizing the Allegheny Portage Railroad which intended to crawl over the Alleghenies with barges on a railroad,\nwhile in New Jersey, John Stevens built a test track in 1825 to experimentally settle the great traction debate and runs a steam locomotive around it in his summer home estate, Hoboken, New Jersey. In 1830, this would result in the Camden and Amboy Railroad incorporation and charter to connect New York harbor with Philadelphia-Trenton by fast railcar service, the first railroad to be 'focused first' on passenger traffic, with the competitive aim of taking on lucrative stagecoach services.\nPennsylvania's second private charter was given to the Delaware and Hudson Gravity Railroad (c.1826, o:1830),\nwhereas the Commonwealth of Massachusetts over chartered the Leiper Railroad's soulmate: the 3 miles (4.8 km) industrial animal powered Granite Railroad opened in Quincy, Massachusetts, to convey quarried granite for the Bunker Hill monument. It later becomes a common carrier railroad and lasted into the 20th century.\nIn the meantime, New York chartered the 16-mile route between Albany and Schenectady for the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad on April 17, 1826 (c.1826, o:1831), based on the idea it was better to travel an hour instead of a day circuitously on the canal around a waterfall.\nand in 1827 the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company built and began operating the 9 miles (14 km) Summit Hill and Mauch Chunk Railroad, while also in 1827, Maryland and Virginia clear needs and issue the charter and rights-of-ways for the ambitious Baltimore and Ohio:\u200a21\u200a \u2014 which becomes the (3rd or 4th) next operational railroad (depending upon how Liepers' withdrawal is counted and scored), running tests in 1829 about the time Leiper and Son are shifting from rail to canal and\nThe Stourbridge Lion, first steam locomotive imported into the USA, is tested along tracks built by the Delaware and Hudson company on August 8, 1829.  Deemed too heavy for the company's rails, it and its three brethren are converted to stationary engines.\n1830 ushers in a flurry of transportation (railroad & canal) incorporations, charter applications, grants and beginnings of construction, and completions of construction and partial or full railway openings.\nThe American built\nThe B&O opens its first 13 miles (21 km) stretch to Ellicott's Mills and begins regular scheduled passenger services on schedule, May 24, 1830.\n1830 the 26 miles (42 km) Beaver Meadows Railroad from Beaver Meadows, Pennsylvania, is incorporated and construction commenced to open a second major coal field to the Lehigh Canal at a second loading facility in Parryville beyond the Lehigh Gap\u2014this offered a more efficient use of the canal with out jamming up the Summit Hill & Mauch Chunk. This would form the seed company of the first class Lehigh Valley Railroad after the 1870s.Built two decades into the brief American canal age, it ran about 3 miles (5 km) along Crum Creek in Delaware County to its mouth in Eastern Pennsylvania's Delaware Valley.  After rights to build the canal were initially denied, for 18 years a horse-drawn industrial railroad, the Leiper Railroad, was used to carry stone products from the quarry to the Delaware dock before the opening of the canal.  Located close to the University of Pennsylvania, one historian has opined that the idea was not Leiper's but belonged to TBDL and found, who became a noted engineer and steam locomotive builder.\nThe tramway became a shortline branch of the B&O railroad in the 1880s.\nCrum Creek's mouth is located at 39\u00b051\u203228\u2033N 75\u00b019\u203214\u2033W.Efforts were made in the 1930s to preserve the remnants of the railroad. The Thomas Leiper Estate was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.

Players work together over a twelve game campaign to build a village, while simultaneously competing to win each game, and ultimately win the campaign. \nPlayers build buildings, score objectives, and spend money to open crates, which add new rules, buildings, and special abilities to the game. When the campaign is finished, players will have a uniquely developed copy of the final game which can then be played thenceforth.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nAt the beginning of the first game, there are six buildings on the board, and players each have two meeples, which they can place on the buildings to collect some of the game's six different resources. These resources can be used to permanently add new buildings to the board in the form of adhesive stickers, which add new actions to the game which the players can take. Players gain points to win each game by building buildings, achieving certain predetermined objectives, paying money to open crates, and spending influence to move up a reputation track.\nOpening crates also unlocks new rules and special abilities, and the players also gain new abilities from special cards they acquire each game. The game board and rules develop uniquely depending on the choices made by the players, so that by the end of a twelve game campaign, each copy of Charterstone has developed into a different permanent game.\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\nResponse to the game has been mostly positive, with reviewers praising the satisfying complex layers of new elements the game ongoingly introduces, but noting that the game is slow to reveal its secrets, and can seem plodding in the early stages of the campaign.Matt Thrower writing for IGN stated that \"

The strike began on 13 October 1969 and lasted for roughly two weeks, with some pits returning to work before others.  The NCB lost \u00a315 million and 2.5 million tonnes of coal as a result of the strike.\n\n\n== Context ==\nAt the time of the strike, wage negotiations were underway between the NCB and the National Union of Mineworkers.  Although that was not the cause of the dispute, it became essential to the settlement of the dispute.  In the 1960s, employment in coal mining had fallen by almost 400,000 with little resistance from the NUM leadership, but the left wing of the union was becoming stronger and drawing strength from the students' protests. When miners staged a protest in London to support their wage claim, many Londoners were surprised that there were still coal mines operating in Britain. The NUM leadership of Sidney Ford was regarded by many within the union as having been too passive and accommodating of a Labour government.\n\n\n== Cause ==\nThe cause was the hours of work for surface workers, who were often older mineworkers who were no longer capable of working underground. Wages were lower, and working hours were longer for surface work than for underground work. The annual conference of the NUM had voted in July 1968 to demand the surface workers' hours be lowered to seven and three-quarters, but the union's executive had not acted upon the vote.\n\n\n== Sequence of events ==\nOn 11 October, Arthur Scargill led a group of Yorkshire mineworkers in pushing for action at the Yorkshire NUM's area council. The president of the Yorkshire NUM, Sam Bullogh, was unwell at the time and ruled Scargill \"

"Martin-Baker_Mk.2| Martin-Baker ejection seats| ","The Martin-Baker Mk.2 is a British ejection seat designed and built by Martin-Baker. Introduced in the early 1950s, the Mk.2 was developed from the Martin-Baker Mk.1, the main improvement being automatic seat separation and parachute deployment.A development of the seat with a longer-stroke ejection gun, duplex drogue and leg restraints was the Martin-Baker Mk.3.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Mk.2 seat was designed as an improved version of the first Martin-Baker seat. Improvements included relocation of the  main parachute and dinghy, automatic parachute deployment and man/seat separation systems to assist incapacitated crews . During 1953 Mk.1 seats in service were modified to Mk.2 standard. The first successful ejection using a Mk.2 seat took place on 15 May 1953, the aircraft involved being a Supermarine Attacker operating from HMS Eagle.\n\n\n== Operation sequence ==\nOperating the face blind firing handle initiates firing of the main gun located at the rear of the seat, the main gun is a telescopic tube with two explosive charges that fire in sequence. As the seat moves up its guide rails an emergency oxygen supply is activated and personal equipment tubing and communication leads are automatically disconnected.A steel rod, known as the drogue gun, is fired and extracts two small drogue parachutes to stabilise the seat's descent path. A barostatic mechanism prevents the main parachute from opening above an altitude of 10,000 ft (3,000 m) A time delay mechanism operates the main parachute below this altitude, the seat then separates from the occupant for a normal parachute descent, a manual separation handle and ripcord is provided should the automatic system fail.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nThe Mk.2 ejection seat has been installed in the following aircraft types:\nList from Martin-Baker.\nAvro Canada CF-100 Canuck\nde Havilland Venom\nEnglish Electric Canberra\nGloster Meteor\nHawker Hunter\nHawker Sea Hawk\nSupermarine Attacker\nSupermarine Swift\nWestland Wyvern\n\n\n== Seats on display ==\nA Martin-Baker Mk.2 seat is on display at the Midland Air Museum.\n\n\n== Specifications (Mk.2) ==\nMaximum operating speed: 400 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS)\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"

He served during the American Revolutionary, the French Revolutionary and the Napoleonic Wars, rising to the rank of Captain.\n\n\n== Family and early life ==\nMounsey was born in 1766, as the fifth son of George Mounsey, of Carlisle. He joined the navy on 23 February 1780, at the age of 13, becoming a midshipman aboard HMS Royal Oak, under Captain Sir Digby Dent, who would become Mounsey's patron. The Royal Oak was sent to the North American Station in May to reinforce Vice-admiral Mariot Arbuthnot's fleet. During the voyage Mounsey took part in the capture of a French East Indiaman. They reached their destination on 13 July, after which Arbuthnot raised his flag aboard the Royal Oak, whilst Dent and Mounsey moved aboard HMS Raisonnable. The Raisonnable then returned home with despatches, but the ship was so badly damaged by a gale whilst crossing the Atlantic, that she was paid off on her arrival for large-scale repairs. Dent and Mounsey transferred again, this time to HMS Repulse, initially under Vice-Admiral George Darby, but later being detached to land stores at Gibraltar in April 1781.Dent and Mounsey were transferred again at the end of the year, this time to the third rate HMS Cumberland. Dent retired about this time due to ill-health, with Captain William Allen. Mounsey and the Cumberland sailed to the East Indies on 6 February 1782, joining the squadron there under Sir Richard Bickerton. They were in time to see action at the Battle of Cuddalore, between Sir Edward Hughes and the Bailli de Suffren. Cumberland had two killed and 11 wounded in the battle, fought on 20 June 1783.  Mounsey returned to England in May 1784, becoming midshipman aboard the sloop HMS Orestes. He passed his lieutenant's examination on 3 December 1788, and went on to serve aboard HMS Arethusa, HMS Victory, HMS Duke and HMS Juno.\n\n\n== Lieutenancy and promotions ==\nWith the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, Mounsey returned to HMS Victory, then under Admiral Lord Hood. He was promoted to lieutenant on 22 May 1793, and appointed to HMS Ardent, under Robert Manners-Sutton, and then to the frigate HMS Lowestoffe. He was present at the occupation of Toulon, and at numerous assaults during the capture of Corsica. Whilst blockading Bastia, he led a dangerous attempt to cut-out a vessel laden with gunpowder, lying the harbour. Mounsey was successful, and the loss of the ship accelerate the fall of the city. He returned to Britain aboard HMS Imperieuse, and was afterwards appointed to HMS Trident, HMS Impregnable, HMS Duke, HMS Defiance and HMS Clyde in succession. On 6 July 1801 he led the boats from Clyde and her escorts to destroy the beached wreck of HMS Jason, coming under heavy fire as they did so. Mounsey remained aboard HMS Clyde until being promoted to commander on 29 April 1802. He was appointed on 17 May 1802 to command of the sloop Rosario. During his time aboard her he was tasked with carrying despatches, reconnoitering enemy positions, escorting convoys, and conducting anti-smuggling patrols. Also during this period he captured a number of enemy merchants, as well as a 22-gun privateer.\n\n\n== HMS Bonne Citoyenne and the Furieuse ==\n\nHe left the Rosario in autumn 1808, and on 18 April 1809, he was appointed to the 20-gun HMS Bonne Citoyenne. He was sent with despatches for Earl St Vincent then at Lisbon. He returned to England after completing this, and on 18 June sailed from Spithead in company with HMS Inflexible. The two were acting as escorts for a convoy bound for Quebec. Whilst travelling with the convoy on 2 July, a suspicious sail was sighted astern, and Mounsey dropped back to investigate. In doing so he lost sight of the convoy and in sailing to rejoin them, came across a French frigate on 5 July, which was in the process of capturing an English merchant. Despite the much larger size of the frigate, Mounsey immediately gave chase, at which the French ship fled northwards. After a chase lasting 18 hours the Bonne Citoyenne caught up with the French ship on the morning of 6 July and brought her to battle. The subsequent engagement lasted seven hours, with Bonne Citoyenne at a disadvantage early on, when three of her guns were dismounted. She nevertheless fired 129 broadsides to the enemy's 70. By the end of the battle Bonne Citoyenne had lost her top masts, her lower masts were badly damaged, and her rigging, sails and boats had been shot to pieces. Running out of powder Mounsey decided to force the issue and ordered his men to be prepared to board the French ship. Before he could do so, the French surrendered and Mounsey took possession.\n\nThe enemy ship was discovered to be the Furieuse, which had sailed from the \u00celes des Saintes on 1 April, carrying sugar and coffee to France. She was capable of carrying 48 guns, but was only carrying 20 at the time. Despite this she had a much larger crew, with 200 sailors, 40 soldiers, and a detachment of troops from the 60th regiment of the line. She had suffered heavy damage, with her masts shot away, five feet of water in the hold and 35 killed and 37 wounded. In contrast, Bonne Citoyenne had just one man killed and five wounded. The frigate was patched up and towed into Halifax, where both were repaired. The captured frigate was later commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Furieuse, whilst the Bonne Citoyenne returned to England in September.\nThe capture of the Furieuse was hailed as a great victory.  Henry Phipps, First Lord of the Admiralty wrote to Mounsey Sir, - I did not fail this day, to lay before his Majesty the particulars of your conduct in the attack and capture of the Furieuse, French frigate, on 6 July. The enterprising gallantry with which you approached and attack a ship bearing such an appearance of a commanding superiority of force, and the skill, courage, and perseverance manifested by you, and the officers, seamen, and marines under your command, during an action of such long continuance, and so warmly contested, have received his Majesty's fullest approbation...\nA round of promotions followed the victory, the first lieutenant was promoted to commander and Mounsey was promoted to post captain. He was offered command of the Furieuse, once she had been repaired, which he accepted, taking command on her commissioning in November 1811.\n\n\n== Command of the Furieuse ==\nMounsey and the Furieuse were initially employed in escorting a convoy to the Mediterranean, after which she joined the fleet blockading Toulon under Admiral Edward Pellew. The French fleet sailed out in May 1812, consisting of 12 sail of the line and seven frigates, of which one ship of the line and two frigates began to chase the British inshore squadron, consisting of the Furieuse, and the frigates HMS Menelaus and HMS Havannah, and the brig HMS Pelorus. The French gave up the chase when the British made clear their intention to fight.On 9 November 1812 Mounsey captured the French privateer Nebrophonus, and on 10 January 1813 captured the privateer Argus. In February 1813 Mounsey supported Charles John Napier in HMS Thames in the capture of the island of Ponza. They landed troops on 26 February, under fire from shore batteries, which soon subdued resistance. The capture of the harbour eliminated an infamous corsair haven, and provided an anchorage for Royal Navy ships watching Naples. On 7 May boats from Furieuse captured the French Conception, towing her out to sea under heavy fire. One man was killed and another five wounded in this operation. On 4 October a convoy was sighted off Civitavecchia. Despite being heavily protected by two gunboats and a number of shore batteries, an operation was attempted. Marines from Furieuse's boats stormed and captured a fort, under cover from Furieuse's guns. The enemy retreated to a nearby castle and continued to fire on the British forces. Nevertheless, the British were able to sink the gunboats, and bring out 16 of the merchant ships. The Furieuse kept up a steady fire, preventing reinforcements from Civitavecchia from intervening. Two of the British party were killed and 10 wounded in the operation.For the rest of 1813 Furieuse formed part of Admiral Sir Josias Rowley's squadron, and was present at the capture of Via Reggio, and the unsuccessful assault on Livorno in December. In early March 1814, still with Rowley, Furieuse assisted in the occupation of La Spezia and the surrounding areas. On 17 April a squadron consisting of Furieuse, HMS Aboukir, HMS Iphigenia, HMS Swallow and HMS Cephalus supported the successful assault on Genoa. The end of the War of the Sixth Coalition in 1814 led to Furieuse transferring to the Caribbean, where she escorted transports. She conveyed the 62nd regiment to Halifax, and with the end of the War of 1812, remained in the area to support the troops.HMS Furieuse was paid off in autumn 1815 and was sold for breaking up in October 1816 at Deptford. Mounsey was nominated a Companion of the Order of the Bath in June 1815, and also received the Naval Gold Medal for the capture of the Furieuse. With the end of the wars with France he retired from active service, and died on 25 September 1830 at the age of 64.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nMarshall, John (1828). \"

She was the daughter of Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAldona married Casimir III of Poland, when he was 15 or 16 years old. The bride was probably of about the same age. The marriage took place on 30 April or 16 October 1325 and was a purely political maneuver to strengthen the first Polish\u2013Lithuanian coalition against the Teutonic Knights. Casimir was seeking allies in the dispute over Pomerania with the Order. Gediminas had just undertaken an unsuccessful attempt to Christianize Lithuania. This coalition was a prelude to the Union of Krewo in 1385, and the Union of Lublin in 1569, which resulted in the creation of a new state, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. The details of the agreement are not known; however, it is known that Gediminas released all Polish captives, some 25,000 people, who returned to Poland. The importance of the marriage was attested by the fact that W\u0142adys\u0142aw abandoned his earlier plans to marry his son to Jutta of Bohemia. The alliance was put into effect when joint Polish\u2013Lithuanian forces organized an attack against the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1326. However, the coalition was not strong and collapsed c. 1330. Yet, there is no evidence of fighting between Poland and Lithuania while Aldona was alive. Aldona died suddenly at the end of May 1339, and was buried in Krak\u00f3w.\nAldona was remembered for her piety and devotion to music. She was accompanied by court musicians wherever she went. It was even suggested by Jan D\u0142ugosz that the cymbals which were played in procession before her represented a pagan Lithuanian tradition. Her husband Casimir is known for his romantic affairs: after Aldona's death he married three more times. Aldona had two daughters:\n\nCunigunde of Poland (died in 1357); married on  1 January 1345 Louis VI the Roman, the son of Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor.\nElisabeth (1326\u20131361); married Bogislaus V, Duke of Pomerania.

"Primal_Integration| Psychotherapy| Humanistic psychology| ","Primal Integration (PI) is a form of personal growth work first formulated by the Canadian Bill Swartley in the mid-1970s. Unlike many other approaches known as psychotherapy, it puts the emphasis on an individual's self-directed exploration of their own  psyche assisted by facilitators who serve the individual and are responsible for their safety. It uses an educational model and is considered to be part of humanistic psychology. It has a different approach to the better known Primal therapy formulated by Arthur Janov and is not related to it except in the broadest sense by its name and by its acceptance of the significance of early  experiences.\n\n\n== Description ==\nDuring the late 1970s Swartley travelled in Europe and was instrumental in setting up centres for Primal Integration in Italy and Britain. Centres also exist in Canada and the USA.\nIts theoretical basis emphasizes early trauma in shaping an individual's consciousness. It claims that trauma that takes place before, during and soon after birth has strong influences on how someone interprets and copes with their future life. These early preverbal traumata, as well as later difficult childhood experiences, can only be fully recognized by re-living the experience at an emotional level. This emotional expression of deep memory is called a \"

"Potocytosis| Cellular processes| ","Potocytosis is a type of receptor-mediated endocytosis in which small molecules are transported across the plasma membrane of a cell. The molecules are transported by caveolae (rather than clathrin-coated vesicles) and are deposited directly into the cytosol.Like other types of receptor-mediated endocytosis, potocytosis typically begins when an extracellular ligand binds to a receptor protein on the surface of a cell, thus beginning the formation of an endocytotic vesicle. The ligand is usually of low molecular mass (e.g. vitamins), but some larger molecules (such as lipids) can also act as ligands.\n\n\n== Mechanism ==\nLipid rafts in the plasma membrane act  as membrane microdomains. They are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids and are involved potocytosis as the lateral compartmentalization of molecules. Caveolae are caveolin-1-enriched smooth invaginations found on these lipid rafts that contribute to transportation of molecules. Potocytosis works by taking up material into caveolae at the surface of the cell.  Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored class of membrane proteins generate high concentrations of molecules. This may either be by releasing a receptor bound molecule, by converting molecules enzymatically or by releasing them from a carrier protein.\n\n\n== References =="

Unlike in other Chatino-speaking towns, loudspeakers used for public announcements broadcast exclusively in Spanish. Spanish is the only language used for government, but Chatino-speaking officials use the language when no monolingual Spanish-speakers are present. Unlike other Chatino communities, ceremonies welcoming new officials to local government are conducted entirely in Spanish.\nChatino speakers know that their numbers are in decline, but there are some movements towards revitalization. There are signs of nostalgia among all community members for the language, including among the younger generation, and public events feature young Chatinos (typically semi-speakers) who are using the language in various ways.

The raid took place in the early morning hours of September 11, 1851, at the house in Christiana, Pennsylvania, of William Parker, himself an escaped slave. This took place after the federal Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 increased penalties for assisting escaped slaves and required state government officials, even in free states such as Pennsylvania, to assist in the recapture of slaves. \nThe confrontation resulted in an exchange of gunfire, the death of Edward Gorsuch, and the dispersal of the raiders. In the aftermath many of the Blacks involved quickly traveled to the safety of Canada. In total, 41 persons were indicted by the federal government for treason, including both Blacks and Whites. Castner Hanway, a white man from Christiana, was the first to be tried, beginning in November 1851. After only 15 minutes of deliberation by the jury he was acquitted, and charges against the remaining defendants were dropped. The issue became a national lightning rod, and aroused strong sectional sentiment. It was one of many events leading to the American Civil War.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the years before the abolition of slavery in the United States, slave-owners of the South pushed for increased federal and state government support for the recovery of escaped slaves. However, in the free states of the North, many residents and governments had resisted, especially given that in the free states many individuals or even state laws protected fleeing slaves.Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which permitted slave owners or their agents to pursue fugitive slaves in free states and required state officials to aid in the recapture of the alleged slaves. Those aiding an escaping slave could face six months' imprisonment and a $1,000 fine.In 1849 Edward Gorsuch, who farmed in Monkton, Maryland, owned twelve slaves.:\u200a4\u200a He considered himself a good slaveholder, freeing some of his slaves at the age of 28 and offering them paid seasonal work after that. With changes in crops and other conditions, slavery was no longer as necessary in Maryland, and there were a relatively high proportion of free blacks. Gorsuch did not sell his excess slaves to the Deep South as many other Maryland slave owners of the time did.:\u200a6\u200a Five bushels of wheat went missing, and Gorsuch was told that some of his slaves had stolen it.:\u200a10\u201311\u200a Four of his older male slaves, Noah Buley, Nelson Ford, George Hammond, and Joshua Hammond, fled north to Pennsylvania, a free state. Gorsuch believed that they had been enticed away and would willingly return if he only talked to them.:\u200a13\u200aChristiana, in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, is 20 miles (32 km) north of the border with Maryland and had become a refuge for fugitive slaves. It was also an area of settlement by numerous free Blacks. This area was frequently raided by slave catchers trying to capture refugee slaves. For two decades, local Blacks had organized for self-protection, at times preventing such capture or even rescuing slaves who had been captured.:\u200a46\u201347\u200a Others chose to flee to Canada.:\u200a46\u200a The leader of the resistance in 1851 was William Parker, an escaped slave about 29 years old.:\u200a161\u2013166\u200a:\u200a47\u201349\u200aIn Philadelphia, where warrants for the arrest of fugitive slaves in Pennsylvania were usually acquired at the federal court after the 1850 act was passed, another group, the Special Secret Committee, had organized to gather information and warn those being hunted.:\u200a53\u200a\n\n\n== Incident ==\n\nEdward Gorsuch heard that his four escaped slaves had taken refuge in Lancaster County. On September 9, 1851, in Philadelphia, he obtained a federal warrant under the Fugitive Slave Act for the arrest of George Hammond, Joshua Hammond, Nelson Ford, and Noah Buley. Henry Kline, a deputy Federal Marshall, was authorized to make the arrests.:\u200a52\u200a Gorsuch hired John Agan and Thompson Tully, Philadelphia police officers, to assist in the arrest.:\u200a53\u200a:\u200a277\u200a These three were to meet with Gorsuch and some additional men at Penningtonville (now Atglen,) a station on the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad.From Philadelphia the group had been watched by Samuel Williams, a member of the Special Secret Committee; he followed Kline and warned the Black community around Christiana that they were coming.:\u200a53\u200a Kline, Agan, and Tully were aware that Williams was following them and knew that secrecy was gone; Agan and Tully returned to Philadelphia because of the risk of violence. Kline had been delayed from the Penningtonville meeting and eventually tracked down the Gorsuch party on the morning of September 10 in Sadsbury. The party entering Christiana were Henry Kline, Edward Gorsuch, his son Dickinson Gorsuch, his nephew Joshua M. Gorsuch, his nephew Dr. Thomas Pierce, Nicholas T. Hutchings, and Nathan Nelson.Shortly after midnight on September 11, the Gorsuch party set out on the raid with a hired, disguised white guide. The first house he took them to supposedly had one of the slaves, but they decided to go to another place where two were staying, before returning for the first. Gorsuch believed that if he had captured two of the slaves, the third, whose wife he still held enslaved, could be persuaded to return. Just before dawn, the group reached William Parker's house, where the guide had said two slaves were staying. The guide left. It is unknown whether the guide had deliberately led them to the center of resistance in Lancaster County.:\u200a54\u201355\u200aWilliam Parker knew the group was hunting slaves. Also in his house were his wife, Eliza; her sister, Hannah; Hannah's husband, Alexander Pinckney; and Abraham Johnson. Two visitors were also there: Joshua Kite, also known as John Beard, who was one of Gorsuch's escaped slaves, probably Nelson Ford; and Samuel Thompson, another of the escaped slaves who had taken a new name. Sarah Pownall, a white neighbor and wife of Parker's landlord, stopped by the evening of September 10 to warn that if the raiders came, all of the blacks should flee to Canada.:\u200a57\u201358\u200aAs the raiders traveled up to Parker's house, which was on a hill, they ran into Joshua Kite, possibly returning home or possibly acting as a lookout, and Gorsuch recognized him as one of the escaped slaves. Kite recognized his former owner and rushed back to the house, yelling a warning. Accounts of events over the next two hours are contradictory.:\u200a58\u201359\u200a Parker and his household moved to the second floor with their guns and were in a good position to defend themselves.The Kline and Gorsuch party surrounded the house, and the US Marshal announced their legal authority to seize Nelson Ford. Parker and his household refused to give up Ford, with some debate. Eliza Parker blew the horn to signal to local Blacks that help was needed. Shots were fired, either first by the posse at Eliza Parker, or first by the household at Gorsuch when he attempted to enter the house; no one was seriously injured at this time.:\u200a62\u200a Dickinson, Gorsuch, and Kline recommended retreat to recruit a larger force; Edward Gorsuch refused. The household asked for time. They discussed whether the two refugee slaves should surrender.:\u200a58\u201362\u200aParker may have been delaying so reinforcements could arrive. Numerous armed men arrived, including Noah Buley, another of Gorsuch's escaped slaves. Also arriving were several neighboring whites, including Elijah Lewis, a local shopkeeper on foot, and Castner Hanway, a local miller on horseback. Gorsuch assumed that the white men, though unarmed, were leaders of the estimated 75 to 150 Blacks, many with guns, who arrived over the next 30 minutes. Kline believed that the white men would join his party in carrying out the law. He identified himself as a US Marshal and talked with them; Hanway refused to help him to arrest anyone. Hanway apparently told Kline and his group to leave before blood was shed. According to Lewis, Hanway begged the Blacks not to shoot.Kline apparently warned Hanway and Lewis they were committing a federal crime by not assisting him. When Edward Gorsuch confronted his slave Samuel Thompson, the man clubbed him. Gorsuch fell and was fatally shot multiple times. His son Dickinson went to his aid, and was also shot multiple times. He was able to move away and was aided by a white man: either Joseph Scarlett (according to Dickinson), or Levi Pownall (according to Parker). Dickinson was taken to the nearby Pownall house where, though initially expected to die, he survived. Lewis left as soon as the violence started, as did Kline, who joined up with Nicholas Hutchins and followed Lewis.Joshua Gorsuch and Thomas Pearce fled when they realized that Edward Gorsuch was being attacked. They were sheltered by Hanway on his horse, but he was also trying to flee. He left at a gallop. Joshua Gorsuch and Thomas Pearce continued to flee; they were shot but escaped (or were let go).:\u200a62\u201373\u200a\n\n\n== Immediate aftermath ==\nParker, Gorsuch's former slaves, and some other blacks fled north to the eventual safety of Canada.:\u200a76\u200a In Rochester, New York, where he was to take a boat to Canada, Parker took refuge in the house of Frederick Douglass. He had known him when both were slaves in Maryland. Douglass arranged for the group to catch the ferry to Canada.:\u200a78\u200a The Christiana Riot had been the latest in a series of confrontations over fugitive slaves, following on the heels of several high-profile cases in Boston including the escape of Shadrach Minkins from custody in February 1851. The Federal government had been stymied in its efforts to enforce those cases, and was becoming harsher to create a deterrent. In the case of the re-enslavement of Thomas Sims in April, federal marshals and army soldiers had been used to keep order. However, these previous incidents had been without white deaths. The death of the slave owner in the Christiana riot led to President Fillmore to call out the marines. They searched the area and eventually arrested 36 blacks and five whites. The federal government, wishing to set an example, charged them with the severe offense of treason. Fillmore's actions were somewhat pragmatic: the issue aroused strong sentiments in the South, and Southerners called for the rioters to be hanged or else the South might secede. It received national press coverage. Northerners were also agitated, as \u2013 according to them \u2013 it demonstrated the reach of the Slave Power and especially the Fugitive Slave Act into the otherwise free North.:\u200a84\u201385\u200a\n\n\n== Legal proceedings ==\nOn October 6, 1851, indictments for the first 38 people listed below were remitted from the District Court to the Circuit Court.:\u200a58\u201359\u200a On November 14, 1851, the Grand Jury of the United States District Court, Philadelphia returned true bills of indictment against 41 people.:\u200a2\u200a Parker and some others were charged in absentia.The 41 men charged (ordered as on the indictment), except where noted, were Black::\u200a84,\u200a96,\u200a199,\u200a210\u200a :\u200a76\u200a :\u200a2\u200a :\u200a153\u200a\n\n\n=== United States vs. Castner Hanway ===\n\nCastner Hanway (sometimes spelled Hanaway), one of the five white men charged and alleged to be a ringleader, was the first to be tried. His trial at the US Courthouse in Philadelphia lasted from November 24 until December 11, 1851. Supreme Court Justice Robert C. Grier and U.S. District Court Judge John K. Kane presided. The prosecution was headed by John W. Ashmead of the US Attorney's office, who was joined by lawyers from Maryland. Thaddeus Stevens headed the defense team.:\u200a116\u200a Theodore Cuyler made the opening speech for the defense.:\u200a127\u200aHanway was acquitted by the jury after 15 minutes of deliberation. The prosecutor then withdrew the other charges, as it was apparent that the charge of treason could hardly be satisfied. The defense pointed out the absurdity of trying a group of poorly armed Quaker farmers for somehow levying war against the United States.\n\n\n== Fate of those involved ==\nWilliam Parker was joined in Canada by Eliza, his wife, in November 1851, and eventually their children. They settled in Buxton, Ontario. He died sometime before 1881, and Eliza died in May 1899. Some of their descendants still live in Canada.Castner Hanway moved in 1878 to Wilber, Nebraska, and died there in 1893.Edward Gorsuch's youngest son, Thomas Gorsuch, and his schoolmate John Wilkes Booth swore revenge for Edward's death.\n\n\n== Historical markers ==\nIn September 1911 a dedication ceremony for a memorial to the incident in Christiana took place with descendants of both sides present and also of Peter Woods, one of those indicted.

"Permissible_exposure_limit| Chemical safety| Concentration indicators| Environmental standards| National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health| Occupational Safety and Health Administration| ","The permissible exposure limit (PEL or OSHA PEL) is a legal limit in the United States for exposure of an employee to a chemical substance or physical agent such as high level noise. Permissible exposure limits are established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  Most of OSHA's PELs were issued shortly after adoption of the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act in 1970.For chemicals, the chemical regulation is usually expressed in parts per million (ppm), or sometimes in milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3). Units of measure for physical agents such as noise are specific to the agent.\nA PEL is usually given as a time-weighted average (TWA), although some are short-term exposure limits (STEL) or ceiling limits. A TWA is the average exposure over a specified period, usually a nominal eight hours. This means that, for limited periods, a worker may be exposed to concentration excursions higher than the PEL, so long as the TWA is not exceeded and any applicable excursion limit is not exceeded. An excursion limit typically means that \"

The system consists of two nearly identical red dwarf stars located in the constellation Draco. The two stars orbit each other with a period of 1.27 days with a separation of 2.7 million kilometres (0.018 AU). Along with two stars in the triple system KOI 126, the stars in CM Draconis are the lightest stars with precisely measured masses and radii. Consequently, the system plays an important role in testing stellar structure models for very low mass stars. These comparisons find that models underpredict the stellar radii by approximately 5%. This is attributed to consequences of the stars' strong magnetic activity.\nAccording to the system's entry in the Combined General Catalogue of Variable Stars, at least one of the components is a flare star and at least one is a BY Draconis variable. The white dwarf star GJ 630.1B, located 25.7 arcseconds away shares the same proper motion as the CM Draconis stars and is thus a true companion star of the system. Given the system's distance of 47 light years, this corresponds to a separation of at least 370 astronomical units between CM Draconis and GJ 630.1B.\n\n\n== Possible planetary system ==\nThe system was the subject of a dedicated search for transiting extrasolar planets in orbit around the binary from 1994\u20131999. In the end, the existence of all of the transiting planet candidates suggested by the project was ruled out.Based on variations in the timing of the system's eclipses, it has been suggested that there may be an object in a circumbinary orbit around the two red dwarf stars. In 2000, it was proposed that a Jovian planet is orbiting the system with a period of 750\u20131050 days. A later analysis of timing variations did not confirm this proposed planet and instead suggested that there was a Jovian planet in an 18.5-year orbit, or a more massive object further out. This analysis was itself not supported by a 2009 study that found the eclipse timings were indistinguishable from linear, though the binary stars do have a small eccentricity that may indicate that they are being perturbed by an orbiting body that prevents the orbit from being fully circularised by tidal effects. A massive planet or brown dwarf on an orbit of 50\u2013200 days would fulfil the observational criteria: the requirement for dynamical stability, the constraints from the lack of observed timing variations and the requirement that the object can maintain the eccentricity of the binary stars.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"

"Com.x| Comic book publishing companies of the United Kingdom| Publishing companies established in 2000| 2000 establishments in the United Kingdom| ","Com.x is a British comic publishing company.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2000\u20132002 ===\nCom.x was founded in 2000 by Eddie Deighton, Russell Uttley and Neil Googe. Deighton later described how the group came together in 1999:\n\nNeil originally came for an interview as a designer at the design agency Russell and myself ran, but as soon as we saw in his portfolio that Neil had trained as a comic artist and had worked on 2000AD, we ended up talking for about 4 hours about comics and the industry in general. By the time we finished, we felt that Neil's talent would have gone to waste if we'd taken him on as a designer, so we decided instead to propose to our client, Konami, that we should work with Neil on a graphic novel for the computer game Silent Hill. They felt it would be a cool thing to do, so Neil came on board and we began developing the project. Very quickly, we found that we all got on really well and by about the third week of working together, we felt we had a lot to contribute to the comic industry in terms of enthusiasm and creativity.\nThe company published a number of titles in the following couple of years like Cla$$war by Rob Williams and Trevor Hairsine, Puncture by Uttley and Ben Oliver, Razorjack by John Higgins and Bazooka Jules by Googe.Rob Williams suggested that the relatively greater impact Com.x had on the American publishing companies was:\n\nIt was purely the American format and the attention we received from the U.S. comic press. I just think Com.X's books talked to the American publishers in their own language\u2014they looked and read like U.S. books so, hey, it\u2019s not that big a leap for American editors to see us working in American books.\nThe downside of this for the company was that their artists, like Trevor Hairsine, Ben Oliver, Joshua Middleton and Neil Googe, were snapped up by Marvel and DC.They ran into bigger problems in 2002 when their offices were burgled and it took them time to recover. Other named projects, like Battle Raven Six by Antony Johnston, were never published and the company went quiet for over a year.\n\n\n=== 2003\u20132004 ===\nThe second phase of the company's activity took place in 2003 and 2004. The first three issues of Cla$$war were collected into a trade paperback in 2003 and the series was finished in 2004 with new artist Travel Foreman. However, when interviewed in 2004 Googe said he did not feel the company had fully returned:\n\nWe have had a few bits out this year, Cla$$war was finished, as was Puncture and we had the Last American graphic novel ... but as a fully functioning publisher ... well no, the simple fact is we underestimated what it would take... and enthusiasm only gets you so far. We never really had that much cash and so when the big guns came knocking for the likes of Trev and Josh, with their promise of great projects, we just couldn't compete. ...\nSo Com.X will continue to chase the deals it's already looking at, as for the comics, I like to think of it as lying dormant until such a time as it can return properly.\nOther titles that were announced as returning, but never appeared, include Bazooka Jules with new artist LeSean Thomas and Thomas' own Cannon Busters.\n\n\n=== 2008\u2013present ===\nThe company returned fully to comics publishing in 2008, led by Eddie Deighton and business partner Benjamin Shahrabani, with a more sustainable business model. To avoid delays in the releasing of series, Deighton said that \"

Doane earned his teaching certificate in 1961 from the Nova Scotia Teachers College (NSTC) and then a bachelor of music education from [Boston University] in 1967 studying the trombone. While serving as supervisor of music for the Halifax Regional School Board from 1967 to 1984, Doane changed the school music program when he began using the ukulele as a practical and economical method of teaching instruments and music for both children and adults. This unconventional approach was quickly proven through the success of Halifax school bands and orchestras in concerts and competitions across Canada.Doane created the Guide to Classroom Ukulele in 1971.  The British Columbia schools used Doane's system to teach music and as a result, the Langley Ukulele Ensemble came into existence. He improved on the system and created the Teacher's Guide to Classroom Ukulele in 1977.\nAfter leaving the Halifax School Board in 1984, Doane served as a professor of music education at his alma mater, the Nova Scotia Teachers College until his retirement in 1993.The best known student to come out of Doane's program is James Hill, who plays the ukulele throughout the world and worked with Doane to revise the ukulele teaching system. Doane and Hill collaborated to create the Ukulele in the Classroom program in 2008.Doane was awarded an honorary doctor of fine arts from St. Mary's University in 2003.His daughter Melanie Doane is a noted Canadian pop singer and songwriter.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since June 12, 2017.The first settlers arrived in what is now Gaines Basin well before the Erie Canal (or any namesake turning basin thereon) did. Lansing Bailey and his brother Joel built a wooden cabin there in 1812. By 1823, as the Erie Canal was nearing completion, the family had moved on, and the building was being used as a school house.It was not long before a burgeoning population\u2014brought on by the Canal and expanding settlement of Orleans County (which split from Genesee County in 1824)\u2014necessitated a larger structure for educating local children. The new school was built in 1832 of local cobblestone, as was common in the area, on land across the road from the old school building. The new building had 913 square feet of space and continued serving as a school until 1944, when centralization caused Gaines District No. 2 to be consolidated into the Albion Central School District.The building sat unused for decades until efforts to preserve the deteriorating building began in 2014. In 2015, a historical marker was added, and by 2017 restoration efforts had progressed enough to have the property listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Also that year, a donated outhouse was moved to the property. By 2021, the interior had been restored to its 1940s appearance, with the original teacher's desk and authentic decor.Having received the property as a donation, the Orleans County Historical Association (which spearheaded the restoration work) intends to use the building for history programs and gatherings.\n\n\n== References =="

After a long career as a ballet dancer and company director, he is now widely considered to be one of the foremost European choreographers of his time.\n\n\n== Early life and training ==\nBorn in Basel into a prosperous family, Heinz Sp\u00f6rli was exposed to theater arts at an early age, thanks to the enthusiasm of his father. As a schoolboy, he appeared as an extra in a number of local productions and sometimes took small acting or dancing roles. At age 17, he began taking ballet classes with Walter Kleiber, a well-known local teacher, while continuing his formal education. Upon graduation from school, he completed his compulsory military service in the Swiss Army before resuming his dance training. Realizing his natural talent for ballet and hoping to make it his career, he devoted himself to his ballet classes and to his studies in dance, music, and art history. During this time, he changed the spelling of his surname from Sp\u00f6rli to Spoerli.\n\n\n== Career ==\nDespite his late start, Spoerli advanced rapidly in his dance training, and in 1960, at age 19, he was engaged as an artist of the Basel Municipal \nTheater, directed by Vaslav Orlikovsky. He continued to improve his classical technique while appearing in operas, operettas, and the spectacular ballet productions that Orlikovsky mounted. In 1963 Spoerli joined the Cologne State Opera Ballet, directed by Todd Bolender. There he was exposed to an international repertory of high caliber, including works of Balanchine, B\u00e9jart, Cranko, de Mille, and Lander. In 1966 he moved to Canada, having been hired as a soloist by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, directed by Arnold Spohr. The following year, 1967, he made his first choreographies, two short pas de deux for the Calgary Ballet Company. After a brief stint back in Cologne, he returned to Canada in late 1967 as a soloist with Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in Montreal. There, under the direction of Ludmilla Chiriaeff and Fernand Nault, he danced in both classical and modern works by Dolin, Lichine, Nault, Paige, Kuch, and Butler. In 1969 Spoerli returned to Switzerland, where he danced as a soloist with the Basel Ballet, directed by Pavel Smok, and then with the Ballet du Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Gen\u00e8ve, directed by Alfonso Cat\u00e1. In Geneva from 1970 to 1973 he again danced in works by Balanchine and other prominent neoclassical choreographers. There, in 1972, he also made his first major ballet, Le Chemin (\"

"Pitted_keratolysis| Bacterium-related cutaneous conditions| ","Pitted keratolysis (also known as Keratolysis plantare sulcatum, Keratoma plantare sulcatum, and Ringed keratolysis) is a bacterial skin infection of the foot. The infection is characterized by craterlike pits on the sole of the feet and toes, particularly weight bearing areas.\nThe infection is caused by Corynebacterium species bacteria and Kytococcus sedentarius. Excessive sweating of the feet and use of occlusive footwear provide an environment in which these bacteria thrive and therefore increase the risk of developing pitted keratolysis.The condition is fairly common, especially in the military where wet shoes/boots are worn for extended periods of time without removing/cleaning. Skin biopsy specimens are not usually utilized, as the diagnosis of pitted keratolysis is often made by visual examination and recognition of the characteristic odor. Wood's lamp examination results are inconsistent. Treatment of pitted keratolysis requires the application of antibiotics to the skin such as benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, or mupirocin. Prevention efforts aim to keep the feet dry by using moisture-wicking shoes and socks as well as antiperspirants.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nPitted keratolysis typically presents with white discoloration of the skin and numerous discrete, \"

"Bacillus_thuringiensis| Bacillus| Biopesticides| Genetically modified organisms in agriculture| Bacteria described in 1915| ","Bacillus thuringiensis (or Bt) is a Gram-positive, soil-dwelling bacterium, the most commonly used biological pesticide worldwide. B. thuringiensis also occurs naturally in the gut of caterpillars of various types of moths and butterflies, as well on leaf surfaces, aquatic environments, animal feces, insect-rich environments, and flour mills and grain-storage facilities. It has also been observed to parasitize other moths such as Cadra calidella\u2014in laboratory experiments working with C. calidella, many of the moths were diseased due to this parasite.During sporulation, many Bt strains produce crystal proteins (proteinaceous inclusions), called delta endotoxins, that have insecticidal action. This has led to their use as insecticides, and more recently to genetically modified crops using Bt genes, such as Bt corn. Many crystal-producing Bt strains, though, do not have insecticidal properties. The subspecies israelensis is commonly used for control of mosquitoes and of fungus gnats.As a toxic mechanism, cry proteins bind to specific receptors on the membranes of mid-gut (epithelial) cells of the targeted pests, resulting in their rupture. Other organisms (including humans, other animals and non-targeted insects) that lack the appropriate receptors in their gut cannot be affected by the cry protein, and therefore are not affected by Bt.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and discovery ==\nIn 1902, B. thuringiensis was first discovered in silkworms by Japanese sericultural engineer Ishiwatari Shigetane (\u77f3\u6e21 \u7e41\u80e4). He named it B. sotto, using the Japanese word sott\u014d (\u5352\u5012, 'collapse'), here referring to bacillary paralysis. In 1911, German microbiologist Ernst Berliner rediscovered it when he isolated it as the cause of a disease called Schlaffsucht in flour moth caterpillars in Thuringia (hence the specific name thuringiensis, \"

It is also used as an endpaper in books.\nThe development of ingres paper for drawing is ascribed to the French Neoclassical artist Dominique Ingres (1780-1867), although modern ingres papers can differ from those actually used by Ingres. Ingres paper's pattern is a laid mesh. The laid effect creates a toothy grain of close lines on one side and a mottled surface on the reverse. The toothiness allows the paper to take charcoal easily and evenly. Ingres paper is favored in book arts for its antique appearance and pH neutrality.\nProminent manufactures include Canson, Hahnem\u00fchle (sometimes called \"

"Tatanua_mask| Collections of Derby Museum and Art Gallery| Ritual masks| Masks in Papua New Guinea| ","A tatanua is a type of traditional mask made by the natives in the province of New Ireland, Papua New Guinea. The masks are made of wood and other natural materials and used in funeral ceremonies called malagan.\n\n\n== Manufacture ==\nTatanua face masks are normally carved from lime wood and completed and decorated with fibres from sugar cane, wool and other animal hair. The face is coloured using chalk and other natural dyes. The type with a high headdress are created using a cane framework that was formerly then covered in bark, although later imported fabric was used as the covering. Besides the fabric, some masks also included imported optical brighteners, which made some nominally white areas slightly blue.The masks are frequently identifiable by the pierced ear lobes and prominent mouth, which is normally carved as if the mouth is open. The masks can also be identified by the asymmetrical hair design: the mask is left bare of hair on one side to mimic how a New Ireland man would shave his head to show that he was in mourning.\n\n\n== Ceremony ==\nTatanua masks are worn by ceremonial dancers and are often a part of New Ireland Malagan rituals. These are funerary religious ceremonies held by the family of the deceased to communicate with deities and to show respect for the deceased. Mannequins or statues representing the soul of the deceased are also shown at the malagan ceremonies. The local people construct them so that they celebrate the dead person's characteristics. They are elaborated with anthropomorphic symbols which are thought to represent the link between the people of New Ireland, their creation and the spiritual world to which they eventually pass on. The dances were performed in groups; only those who were respected would be allowed the honour of performing the dance, as it was important that observers see the community's strength.The carved masks may take many months to construct, so that the person's death may not be formally marked for some time. The celebrations would be used as a time for the community to illustrate its skills to its neighbours as well as to meet, agree and perform the cultural aspect of a community member dying.\n\n\n== Examples ==\nExamples of this style of mask can be seen in the Ethnological Museum of Berlin, Derby Museum and Art Gallery, the British Museum and the Indianapolis Museum of Art.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nEharo mask\nTopeng\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMalanggan: Art, Memory and Sacrifice, Susanne K\u00fcchler, Berg Publishers\nTatanua Masks from New Ireland, RandAfricanArt.com"

Sherman (born October 25, 1949) is an American experimental criminologist and police educator who is the founder of evidence-based policing.\nSherman's use of randomized controlled experiments to study deterrence and crime prevention has led him to examine such wide-ranging issues as domestic violence, saturation patrol, gun violence, crack houses, and reintegrative shaming. He has collaborated with over 30 police and justice agencies around the world, and been credited as a key founder of the field of experimental criminology.\nSherman holds the posts of Director of the Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology and Wolfson Professor of Criminology Emeritus at the University of Cambridge, where he is also Chair of the Cambridge Police Executive Program. He is also  the Director of the Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing, and Editor-in-Chief of the Centre's Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSherman graduated magna cum laude from Denison University in 1970, with a B.A. in Political Science. He received an M.A. in social science from the University of Chicago in 1970, earned a Diploma in Criminology from Cambridge University in 1973, and received his M.A. and Ph.D.in sociology from Yale University in 1974 and 1976 respectively.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nSherman's career began at age 20 in the New York City Mayor's Office and Police Department as an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation New York City Urban Fellow and aide to the NYPD's Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy, where he began a long research partnership with NYPD Assistant Chief Tony Bouza. Bouza became the Minneapolis Police Chief in 1980, where he persuaded the City Council to approve Sherman's research design to randomly assign arrest for misdemeanor domestic violence, later known as the Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment. Sherman's early experimental research into the influence of arrest on recidivism in spouse abuse led to changes in police department policies and procedures nationwide, encouraged state legislatures to modify state statutes to allow for misdemeanor arrest, and eventually resulted in five federally funded replications, one of which Sherman led in Milwaukee. In the late 1980s, Sherman's discovery of hot spots of crime  led to his experimental research with David Weisburd and Tony Bouza that was first to show clear crime prevention effects of directed police patrol in high crime locations. In the early 1990s, Sherman's Kansas City Gun Experiment studied the effect of concentrated police patrol on gun crime and violence and that directed police patrol in gun crime \"

It is considered to be one of the biggest rivalries in Gaelic games. Mayo's home ground is MacHale Park in Castlebar, while Galway play their home games in Salthill's Pearse Stadium or St Jarlath's Park in Tuam.\nThe Tribesmen have enjoyed greater success in the All-Ireland, having won nine titles to Mayo's three. The rivalry has historically been good-natured but has taken on a harder edge since the turn of the millennium, with the mood between supporters souring.\n\n\n== History ==\nOne of the oldest rivalries in Gaelic football, the fixture was first contested in the 1901 Championship with Mayo winning by 2-4 to 0-3 on the day. The game, which took place in Claremorris on 9 November 1902, was the first official final of the Connacht Championship. The Connacht GAA Council was founded on the same day.Mayo were the first of the two to contest an All-Ireland final, when they faced Wexford in the 1916 final. Galway became the first to win the tournament in the 1925 Championship (though the Championship itself was not completed until 1926). The 1930s was the greatest era of dominance for the two teams; between 1932 and 1942 Galway and Mayo contested eight All-Ireland senior finals, with Galway winning titles in 1934 and 1938, and Mayo winning their maiden title in 1936. The teams were also two of the strongest teams in the country in the 1950s and 1960s, with Mayo winning in 1950 and 1951, and Galway winning in 1956, 1964, 1965 and 1966. In that era, each team regularly gave the other their toughest game of the year. Following Galway's 1966 triumph however, no Connacht team would win an All-Ireland for another 32 years.The rivalry has historically been characterised as relatively friendly, with many Galway and Mayo players from the 1950s\u201360s teams having attended the same schools and players from the border areas having family ties in the other county. This is in contrast to the more bitter rivalries in the sport like Cork\u2013Kerry or Armagh\u2013Tyrone. The good-natured rivalry has also been attributed to the similarities between the two counties and the shared socio-economic challenges they have faced through the years. With a total of nearly 40,000 people emigrating from the two counties from 1951 to 1966, their shared success in football was considered one of the few bright spots in that era.The friendliness of the contest has been tested in recent years however. Following defeats for Mayo in the 1996 and 1997 All-Ireland finals, Galway knocked Mayo out in the opening round of the 1998 Championship and went on to win the title. Galway, who were managed by Mayo-man John O'Mahony, also won the title in 2001. Galway's win, on the back of Mayo's two defeats and under the stewardship of a Mayo native, left a sour taste.

He specialized in number theory and analysis, and proved several results that eluded even Gauss. Like Galois and Abel before him, Eisenstein died before the age of 30. He was born and died in Berlin, Prussia.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHis parents, Johann Konstantin Eisenstein and Helene Pollack, were of Jewish descent and converted to Protestantism prior to his birth. From an early age, he demonstrated talent in mathematics and music. As a young child he learned to play piano, and he continued to play and compose for piano throughout his life.\nHe suffered various health problems throughout his life, including meningitis as an infant, a disease that took the lives of all five of his brothers and sisters. In 1837, at the age of 14, he enrolled at Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium, and soon thereafter at Friedrich Werder Gymnasium in Berlin. His teachers recognized his talents in mathematics, but by 15 years of age he had already learned all the material taught at the school. He then began to study differential calculus from the works of Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange.\nAt 17, still a student, Eisenstein began to attend classes given by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and others at the University of Berlin. In 1842, before taking his final exams, he traveled with his mother to England, to search for his father. In 1843 he met William Rowan Hamilton in Dublin, who gave him a copy of his book on Niels Henrik Abel's proof of the impossibility of solving fifth-degree polynomials, a work that would stimulate Eisenstein's interest in mathematical research.\n\n\n== Five remarkable years ==\nIn 1843 Eisenstein returned to Berlin, where he passed his graduation exams and enrolled in the University the following autumn. In January 1844 he had already presented his first work to the Berlin Academy, on cubic forms in two variables. The same year he met for the first time with Alexander von Humboldt, who would later become Eisenstein's patron. Humboldt managed to find grants from the King, the government of Prussia, and the Berlin academy to compensate for Eisenstein's extreme poverty. The money, always late and grudgingly given, was earned in full measure by Eisenstein: in 1844 alone he published over 23 papers and two problems in Crelle's Journal, including two proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity, and the analogous laws of cubic reciprocity and quartic reciprocity.\nIn June 1844 Eisenstein visited Carl Friedrich Gauss in G\u00f6ttingen. In 1845, Kummer saw to it that he received an honorary doctorate at the University of Breslau. Jacobi also encouraged the distinction, but later relations between Jacobi and Eisenstein were always rocky, due primarily to a disagreement over the order of discoveries made in 1846. In 1847 Eisenstein habilitated at the University of Berlin, and he began to teach there. Bernhard Riemann attended his classes on elliptic functions.\n\n\n== Imprisonment and death ==\nIn 1848 Eisenstein was imprisoned briefly by the Prussian army for his revolutionary activities in Berlin. Eisenstein always had republican sympathies, and while he did not actively participate in the revolution of 1848, he was arrested on 19 March of that year. Although he was released just one day later, the harsh treatment he suffered damaged his already delicate health. But his association with the Republican cause led to his official stipends being revoked, despite Humboldt tenaciously coming to his defense.\nDespite his health, Eisenstein continued writing papers on quadratic partitions of prime numbers and the reciprocity laws. In 1851, at the instigation of Gauss, he was elected to the Academy of G\u00f6ttingen; one year later, this time at the recommendation of Dirichlet, he was also elected to the Academy of Berlin.\nHe died of tuberculosis at the age of 29. Humboldt, then 83, accompanied his remains to the cemetery. He had recently obtained, too late, as it turned out, the funding necessary to send Eisenstein on holiday to Sicily.\n\n\n== Purported Gauss quote ==\n\nE. T. Bell in his 1937 book Men of Mathematics (page 237) claims that Gauss said \"

The painting depicts three nighttime city scenes from the Weimar Republic.  The painting belongs to the Kunstmuseum Stuttgart since it was bought from the artist's estate in 1972.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe main topic of the tryptych is the different aspects of the nightlife in a German big city of the golden twenties. The interior of a dance bar is shown on the middle panel. A band dominated by brass is playing on the left. The rich and beautiful sit and stand on the right. The women present visible jewelry and wear dresses, the fabrics and patterns of which could also be found in medieval paintings. The two groups are joined by a couple dancing Shimmy. Their bodies are reflected in the polished parquet. The background of the room is kept dark red. On the left panel, several prostitutes stand contemptuously in front of the bar's red-lit entrance, looking at two men, one lying on the floor and the other a war cripple. The men are barked at by a dog. On the very outside you can see an almost hidden woman looking out of a gate. The right panel shows a group of high-class prostitutes dressed in furs, who seem to be striving towards the viewer in a row and carelessly walking past another war cripple. The fur collar and the red dress of the foremost reproduce the appearance of a vulva. The right panel ends in a wild architecture that does not seem to be correct.\nThe themes of the painting are femininity, decadence and sexuality in the modern city.

"Periyanayagi_Madha_Shrine,_Avur| Churches in Pudukkottai district| Roman Catholic churches in Tamil Nadu| 1547 establishments in India| ","Periyanayagi Madha Shrine is a Roman Catholic church in the village of Avur, 28 kilometres (17 mi) from the town of Pudukkottai in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It was constructed by Rev. John Venatius Bachet in 1547. The church was rebuilt in 1747. The renowned Italian missionary and Tamil scholar Joseph Beschi served in this church.\n\n\n== History of Avur ==\nThe Sangam poet Avur Kizhar was born in Avur, at that time it was a village with the Pudukkottai - Tiruchirappalli border.\nApparently, the village is called 'a + oor' ('cow village') because of the large numbers of wild bulls and cows that used to graze in an oorani (drinking water tank) on the outskirts of a jungle here.\n\n\n== Church & Missionary Activities ==\nEarly in the 17th century, the Madurai Mission extended its jurisdiction to Tiruchirappalli from Avur, which was sparsely populated in the 15th and 16th centuries.Later Father Emmanuel Martins chose Avur as a site for his Mission. It was granted by the Perambur Kattalur Palayakarars in 1686. Initially the place was under the jurisdiction of the Kolattur Tondaimans, and then later by the  Tondaimans as well.\nThis monument is made up of eight columns raised 56 feet above the ground, and shaped like a cross, measuring 240 feet in length, 38 feet in width, and 28 feet in height.\nFather Venantius Bouchet, the first missionary at Avur, who joined the Madurai Mission in 1688, aimed to make Avur a Christian centre of considerable importance. The chapel was a special area of inspiration for him. With the contributions from well-wishers and Tondaiman, an impressive chapel much stronger than simply mud walls and thatched roofs had been completed in 1697.\nRaghunatha Raya Tondaiman met Bishop of Santhome on his first pastoral trip to Madurai Mission and Avur in 1711, when he visited Avur as the founder of Pudukkottai Tondaimans. A non-Christian king responded with great courtesy to a visiting priest. This is a gesture of great significance for one who does not hold a Christian faith.\n\n\n== Poignant Incident ==\nThe church's fortunes changed drastically in 1716. The conflict between the Nayak rulers, who allied with Mughals and the Tondaimans caused the foundations of the church to be razed to the ground. The incident is described in the General History of Pudukkottai State. A few soldiers of the Tondaiman had managed to steal some bullocks from the Mughal army not far from Avur. The Mughal became furious, and the Missionary was asked to either return the bullocks or to surrender his life.\nRev. Fr. Beschi, the missionary in temporary charge of Avur at the time, had to answer the charge. As he could not get the bullocks back, he quietly accepted the soldiers' alternative proposal. As the infuriated soldiers were unable to hurt their prisoner, they chained him up and led him to their camp amidst insults and threats. When they found that the prisoner bore the treatment with unflinching tranquility, they became so exasperated that they stripped him naked exposed him to the midday sun.\nHowever, as soon as the chief, Chanda Sahib, learned of this, he immediately ordered the prisoner's release. In a tender embrace, the chief asked the missionary to sit at his side; when the missionary protested, the chief explained that his actions had been done without his knowledge. The men, who had insulted the missionary a short time earlier, were moved by the honour shown to him. Indeed, the danger he had incurred led to his safety and to that of the village.\n\n\n== Festival ==\nA Passion play takes place during the Easter season, followed by a car festival in the summer, which attracts people of all faiths.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nTourist Guide to Tamil Nadu.

It is officially headed by Amii Omara-Otunnu.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe government of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, which has been in power since 1986, formerly banned other political parties, but in a 2005 referendum, opposition parties were re-legalised.In May 2013, David Sejusa, who had held important positions in the national government and a former fighter in the rebellion that brought Museveni to power after the ouster of Milton Obote, parted ways with Uganda's establishment and left the country for England. Sejusa made allegations that Museveni's son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, was being prepared to eventually simply replace his father as president, in effect establishing a monarchy. Kainerugaba denied the allegations, while his father made no public statements about his future plans.In November 2013, while living in exile in England, Sejusa was removed from his seat as a member of Uganda's parliament due to his prolonged absence. That same month, Sejusa and others announced the formation of the Freedom and Unity Front as a new political party in Uganda.

"Rosenberg_Castle_(Obwalden)| Castles in Obwalden| ","Rosenberg Castle is a ruined castle in the municipality of Giswil in the canton of Obwalden in Switzerland.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nRosenberg Castle is the westernmost of three ruined castles in Giswil.  Traditionally thought to be part of a defensive line due to their proximity and that they lay in a straight line, they are now generally believed to be three separate castles built for different purposes.  The easternmost, Rudenz Castle was built by the Knights of Rudenz in the early 13th century.  It lies about 2 km (1.2 mi) from Rosenberg.  The center castle, Hunwil Castle was completely demolished to provide stone for the parish church which was dedicated in 1635.The village of Giswil was a fief of Murbach-Lucerne Abbey in the 9th century.  An ecclesiastical bailiff administered the Abbey's lands and had a residence somewhere in the village.  By the 12th century the bailiff had a stone building on the castle site.  It was demolished and replaced with a tower house in the 13th century.  The tower was probably surrounded by a ring wall and ditch, though no traces remain.\nIn 1291 the Habsburgs bought the town of Lucerne and the Unterwalden estates, including Giswil, from Murbach Abbey.  The Habsburgs appointed one of their vassals as the bailiff, probably making it a hereditary office.  The last member of this vassal family is mentioned in 1347 as Mathis the Meier von Giswil.  After his death, the office passed to the Rudenz family, who already owned a castle and estates in Giswil.  A few years later, in 1361, the Rudenz family had to give Rosenberg to Landammann of Obwalden George von Hunwil, who began building Hunwil Castle.  In 1382, George von Hunwil was forced to leave Obwalden for Lucerne.  In 1387 Jenni von Wennishusen was the bailiff over the village, living in either Rosenberg or Hunwil Castles.  Around 1400 the parish of Giswil bought the former ecclesiastical lands and Rosenberg Castle lost its importance as the center of those lands.The castle was mentioned as destroyed in a record from 1532.  In 1664-67 the chapel of St. Anthony of Padua was built near the ruins.  During the 17th century, the name Rosenberg started to be used for the castle ruins.  By 1900 only an overgrown mound remained of the castle.  In 1935 the castle site was purchased by the Canton and in the following year it was excavated, cleaned and repaired.  A small archeological expedition in 1990 found a few artifacts and traces of the 12th century stone building.\n\n\n== Castle site ==\nThe castle is a square stone tower of about 9.3 m \u00d7 9.3 m (31 ft \u00d7 31 ft).  The walls are up to 2 m (6.6 ft) thick and are up to 3 m (9.8 ft) high.  The large window openings are visible at the top of the remaining walls.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of castles and fortresses in Switzerland\n\n\n== References =="
"Hordeum_brachyantherum| Hordeum| Bunchgrasses of North America| Bunchgrasses of Asia| ","Hordeum brachyantherum,  known by the common name meadow barley, is a species of barley. It is native to western North America from Alaska to northern Mexico, coastal areas of easternmost Russia (Kamchatka), and a small area of coastal Newfoundland.\nThe diploid cytotype occurs only in California, throughout the state, while everywhere else plants are tetraploid.\nThis is a tufting perennial bunchgrass approaching a meter in maximum height. It produces compact, narrow inflorescences 8 to 10 centimeters long and purplish in color. Like other barleys the spikelets come in triplets. It has two small, often sterile lateral spikelets on pedicels and a larger, fertile central spikelet lacking a pedicel.\n\n\n== General information ==\nHordeum brachyantherum belongs to grass family, Poaceae, genus Hordeum. There are two common cytotypes of Hordeum brachyantherum.  The diploid mainly grow in California, the tetraploid grow widely over the world. Polyploidy is very common in plants. Polyploidization plays an important role in plant evolution, it is commonly used in agriculture to develop novel phenotypes. Polyploidization also occurs naturally in plant populations. In 1980, a rare hexaploid form of Hordeum brachyantherum was discovered in California within the populations of diploid and tetraploid Hordeum brachyantherum. It was hypothesized that this hexaploid form was evolved by outcrossing between diploid Hordeum marine and tetraploid Hordeum brachyantherum ssp. brachyantherum and followed by duplication of chromosome. Polyploidization may lead to speciation because the reproductive isolation may develop between hexaploid and either tetraploid or diploid due to the mistake of alignment during meiosis.\n\n\n== Homology ==\nHordeum contains a gene called hordoindoline that involves grain hardness and antimicrobial activity. Since wheat contains a homologous gene named puroindoline, it was concluded that Hordeum and wheat shared a common ancestor during the evolutionary process. The novel variants of hordoindoline genes were found in Hordeum brachyantherum. It was hypothesized that the novel genes arose due to the gene duplication during the early stage of the divergence of the genus Hordeum. Some of the non-synonymous mutations are beneficial and show an overall improved antifungal activity. These non-synonymous mutations provide the material for evolution because natural selection can select for organisms who possess these mutations and alter the allele frequency over time.\n\n\n== Salinity ==\nNatural selection can also act on salinity tolerance for many plants. High salinity may negatively impact germination success, plant growth, and survival. Thus, under evolutionary process including natural selection, some plants developed morphological and physiological adaptations to live in high salinity conditions. The effect of salinity on germination rate shows both inter-specific and intra-specific variation. Compared to other perennial plants such as Agrostis stolonifera, Hordeum brachyantherum is more tolerated under high salinity. The seedling lengths and root or shoot lengths show different responses to high salinity. The seedling lengths of Hordeum brachyantherum are more negatively affected by high salinity. The intra-specific variation in the ability to tolerate elevated salinity among populations of Hordeum brachyantherum may result from the genetic variation which underlines the basis of evolution of Hordeum brachyantherum.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nOne major function of perennial plants is to restore the land and ecosystem. Hordeum brachyantherum is used to restore the native perennial grasslands in California and to reduce the density of non-native annual plants. The perennial plants can rapidly recover the soil microbial biomass in the grasslands due to the carbon supply maintained by the perennial plants. The species diversity and composition is not affected by the restoration, however, the relative proportion of the native plant biomass increased in the restored perennial grassland.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJepson Manual Treatment\nUSDA Plants Profile\nPhoto gallery"

As of 2019, it has not been named.\n\n\n== Orbit and classification ==\n\n1999 CW8 is an Apollo asteroid that crosses Earth's orbit. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.9\u20133.6 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,221 days; semi-major axis of 2.24 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.60 and an inclination of 34\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid never approaches Earth closer than 0.2 AU in the foreseeable future, but occasionally makes close approaches to Mars of 0.07 AU. It makes one such approach in 2073, at 0.067 AU, and another one in 2103, at 0.094 AU. Due to 1999 CW8's relatively high inclination, although it passes closer to the Sun than the Earth (0.9 AU), it never comes closer than 0.2 AU.\n\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\nIt is a carbonaceous B-type asteroid, relatively rare in the asteroid belt but common in the inner Solar System. Based on an absolute magnitude of 18.6, and an assumed albedo of 0.159 (derived from the B-type asteroid 2 Pallas), the asteroid can be estimated to have a mean-diameter of approximately 640 meters. If it impacted the Earth would cause significant damage, but not as much as the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event progenitor, which brought about a mass extinction, as it is only 1/20 to 1/10 the size. However, it is unlikely to come close enough to Earth to impact it, or even become a risk of impact.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMars-crossing asteroid\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(523972) 1999 CW8 at NeoDyS-2, Near Earth Objects\u2014Dynamic Site\nEphemeris \u00b7 Obs prediction \u00b7 Orbital info \u00b7 MOID \u00b7 Proper elements \u00b7 Obs info \u00b7 Close \u00b7 Physical info \u00b7 NEOCC\n(523972) 1999 CW8 at ESA\u2013space situational awareness\nEphemerides \u00b7 Observations \u00b7 Orbit \u00b7 Physical Properties \u00b7 Summary\n(523972) 1999 CW8 at the JPL Small-Body Database"

The force consists of 16,000 soldiers: 2500 officers and active-duty soldiers and 13,500 reservists. It includes an Army and an Air Corps.\nThe South Ossetian Army was formed in 1992, and is the primary defense force in the breakaway republic of South Ossetia, largely considered to be within internationally recognized Georgian territory.\nAccording to the 2017 agreement with Russia, parts of the South Ossetian forces were integrated with Russia's 4th Guards Military Base stationed in the territory, while the size of the entity's remaining military is to be agreed with the Russian authorities.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Ossetian Republican Guard (Russian: \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u044f \u041e\u0441\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0438) was organized on 15 November 1991 to participate in the defence of the national capital of Tskhinvali. Just a week later, Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia ordered over 10,000 soldiers to the republic. When it was created, it was mostly a loosely organized group of guerillas. It was a participant in the 1991\u20131992 South Ossetia War, providing 2,400 guardsmen to fight against forces from the National Guard of Georgia. On 17 November 1992, the Supreme Soviet of South Ossetia approved the formation the Ministry of Defence to lead the military. The first combat units of the national armed forces were formed in February 1993. The first units in the MoD was the Military Intelligence Unit and the Artillery Division.\n\n\n=== 2008 South Ossetia War ===\nThe South Ossetian military fought against the Georgian forces in the 2008 South Ossetia War. At the time of the major Georgian offensive, the bulk of the Ossetian force was concentrated in the settlement of Java to the north of Tskhinvali. According to Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, what thwarted the Georgian operation in the end was the resistance offered by peacekeepers and lightly armed South Ossetian units that stayed behind to defend the capital. Also Russian regular army forces entered the fighting on August 8 and drove deep into Georgia proper, occasionally accompanied or followed by South Ossetian militia who committed serious human rights violations, particularly in the Georgian villages of South Ossetia.According one estimate, the losses of the South Ossetian military forces, militia, and volunteers in the war amounted to 150 dead.

"CBS_Studios| CBS Studios| Television production companies of the United States| Paramount Global subsidiaries| Companies based in Los Angeles| 2006 establishments in California| American companies established in 2006| Mass media companies established in 2006| ","CBS Studios is an American television production company which is a subsidiary of CBS Entertainment Group unit of Paramount Global. It was formed on January 17, 2006, by CBS Corporation as CBS Paramount Television, as a renaming of the original incarnation of the Paramount Television studio. It is the television production arm of the CBS network (CBS Productions previously assumed such functions until 2004, when it was merged into Paramount Television), and, along with AT&T subsidiary WarnerMedia through its Warner Bros. Television Studios, it is also the television production arm of The CW (in which Paramount has a 50% ownership stake).\n\n\n== Background and timeline ==\n\n\n=== CBS ===\nIn 1952 the Columbia Broadcasting System formed an in-house television production unit, CBS Productions (commonly referred to as The CBS Television Network), as well as facilities in the newly established Television City in the Fairfax District, Los Angeles in Westside.  Also formed is CBS Television Film Sales (later known as CBS Films) as the distributor of off-network and first-run syndicated programming to local television stations in the United States and abroad.\nIn 1963, CBS Studio Center is established in Studio City, Los Angeles district of Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley. Later in 1971, CBS Films is spun off as Viacom International, Inc. The company is re-established as CBS, Inc., in 1974. In 1978, the production unit gained the secondary/alternate name CBS Entertainment Productions.\nIn 1994, Westinghouse Electric acquired CBS. Viacom merged with its creator CBS, in 1999.\n\n\n=== Paramount Pictures' early television ventures ===\nIn 1939, experimental television stations were established in Los Angeles (W6XYZ) as Television Productions Inc. and Chicago (W9XBK) with Balaban and Katz. Commercial broadcasting began in 1943 over WBKB in Chicago (now WBBM-TV). Commercial broadcasting began in 1947 over KTLA in Los Angeles. In 1949, the first major studio to establish program syndication as Paramount Television Network (much of which originated from KTLA). Paramount branched out of broadcasting in 1964 with the sale of KTLA to Gene Autry.\n\n\n=== Desilu Productions ===\nDesilu Productions formed in 1950 by Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball. Desilu Studios was established in Hollywood and Culver City in 1957, after Arnaz/Ball purchased the RKO Pictures studio lot. Desilu Sales Inc. was formed in 1962 as the company's syndication arm. In 1967, Desilu Productions was acquired by Gulf and Western Industries. The company becomes the TV division of Paramount Pictures Corporation in July, retaining the Desilu name until the end of that year. Desilu Sales, in turn, merges with Paramount's syndication division to become Paramount Television Sales.\n\n\n=== Paramount Television ===\nFrom 1966 to 1967, Gulf+Western acquired Paramount Pictures and Paramount Television Enterprises released 60 titles from their post-1949 feature film library to television broadcasters under the Paramount Portfolio I umbrella package. In 1968 Paramount Television, formerly Desilu, was established as the studio's television production unit. In 1977, Paramount Television Service was formed. In 1982 Paramount Television Group and Paramount Domestic Television and Video Programming was established. In September 1989, Gulf+Western was reincorporated as Paramount Communications, Inc.. On March 11, 1994, Viacom acquired Paramount Communications, resulting in the formation of Paramount/Viacom as a byline for several of Viacom's subsidiaries. In 1995, Viacom launched the United Paramount Network (UPN) with Chris-Craft Industries.\n\n\n=== CBS Paramount Television ===\nOn August 10, 2004 Viacom merged the international television banners of CBS Broadcast International and Paramount International Television to form CBS Studios International. On September 7, 2004, Viacom merged CBS Productions and Paramount Network Television to form a new entity of Paramount Network Television, aka the CBS Paramount Television Entertainment Group, with CBS Productions becoming an in-name only unit.On January 1, 2006, when the CBS/Viacom split took effect, CBS inherited Paramount's television program library, with the second Viacom keeping Paramount's films, the MTV Networks and the BET Networks. On January 17, 2006, CBS Corporation CEO Les Moonves announced that Paramount Television would be renamed CBS Paramount Television as of that day, with both the CBS 'eyemark' and Paramount's mountain united in the new logo, and the network division becoming CBS Paramount Network Television, and the domestic distribution arm becoming CBS Paramount Domestic Television. On July 17, 2006, Jeffrey Kramer, who was formerly employee of David E. Kelley Productions, started a company called Juniper Place Productions, which was affiliated with the studio.On September 26, 2006, CBS Corporation merged its television distribution arms\u2014King World, CBS Paramount International Television and CBS Paramount Domestic Television\u2014to form CBS Television Distribution (CBSTVD). CBS Home Entertainment was then established as a subsidiary of the latter. On January 25, 2007, CSI producers Carol Mendelsohn and Ann Donahue had reupped their deal with the studio. In 2008, 90210 and The Cleaner began using the CBS Productions logo in place of CBS Paramount's, becoming a legacy in-name only credit for the studio that lasted until 2012 for most of the newer shows.On May 17, 2009, CBS quietly drops the Paramount name after a 3+1\u20442-year loan of its use from the sister company Viacom, forming CBS Television Studios.\n\n\n=== CBS Television Studios ===\n\nCBS Paramount Television was the only CBS division that used the Paramount name and logo in its own name and logo (Paramount Pictures was owned by the post-2006 Viacom that was spun off from CBS, which was once known as the first Viacom). All three of its original divisions had used Paramount in their name: CBS Paramount Network Television (the production arm), CBS Paramount Domestic Television (the US distribution arm), and CBS Paramount International Television (the international distribution arm). When the companies split, CBS had permission to use the Paramount name for three years. The contract expired in 2009, and thus the Paramount name was gone from television for good, after 42 years as a production company (39 as Paramount Television), and before that, the owners of two early television stations (KTLA and WBBM-TV), an earlier production company (Telemount Productions), and part-owners of the DuMont Television Network until its revival in 2013 now running as Paramount Television Studios. Though on May 16, 2009, the network arm became CBS Television Studios, going in line with the distribution arm of the studio. Although most of the new shows carried the CBS Productions logo such as 90210, Melrose Place, The Good Wife and Three Rivers, the new CBS Television Studios logo would be used on new seasons of existing TV shows such as the CSI and NCIS franchises. Though in 2012, most of the new shows dropped the legacy CBS Productions logo entirely, replaced by CBS Television Studios' own logo.National Amusements retained majority control of both CBS and the second Viacom. For a short time, many of Paramount's theatrical films were distributed domestically by CBS Television Distribution (the new name for the distribution arm as of 2007).  Paramount Home Entertainment continues to distribute home video sales of CBS shows through the CBS DVD brand.\nThe studio had an output deal with Australia's Network 10, in which Ten receives first airing rights to the studio's productions. The deal ended after Network Ten's administration and later acquisition by CBS in 2017, giving Ten acquisition rights through now-owner CBS Studios International.\nUntil recently in the U.S., King World distributed its product independently from CBS Paramount Domestic Television, while internationally CBS Paramount International Television handled distribution and sales. As of September 16, 2007, the CBS Television Distribution logo appears after shows that had been distributed by King World.\nFrom 2009 until 2011, all shows produced by the company aired on either CBS or The CW. In the past, Paramount Television produced shows for all networks, but especially had a good relationship with ABC (much as Universal Television had a good relationship with eventually sister network NBC). The Cleaner, which aired on A&E until September 2009, was the most recent show from the company to air on a network other than CBS or the CW (which is ironic when NBC/ABC's ownership of A&E is taken into account). This was until BET began airing new episodes of The Game in 2011. In 2012, USA Network began airing Common Law.\nCTS does not directly produce any shows appearing on Showtime, a premium cable television network co-owned with the studio. Instead, sister company Showtime Entertainment handles in-house productions for the network. However, CTD and its international arm handle syndication distribution for these shows if they ever appear in syndication.\nOn June 10, 2010, two former Sony-affiliated producers Eric and Kim Tannenbaum (of The Tannenbaum Company) and Sarah Timberman and Carl Beverly (of Timberman/Beverly Productions) inked a deal with the studio to produce new shows.On October 25, 2018, CBS Television Studios announced the opening of a new animation division named CBS Eye Animation Productions. A new Star Trek series entitled Star Trek: Lower Decks was announced at the same time.In January 2019, Disney+ ordered Diary of a Future President from CBS Television Studios, its first series from an outside production company.It was announced on August 14, 2019, that parent company CBS Corporation would reunite with Viacom into a combined media company and be renamed ViacomCBS. For the first time in 13 years, ViacomCBS will encompass Paramount's film studio, the current incarnation of its television division and CBS's production studio under one umbrella.\n\n\n=== CBS Studios ===\nOn October 8, 2020, it was announced that CTS had been renamed CBS Studios as part of a unification of branding elements between CBS divisions, citing that use of the word \"

Andrus Wildlife Management Area in his honor. In 2018, the Cecil D. Andrus\u2013White Clouds Wilderness was renamed after him. A political liberal, he protected the environment by minimizing the control of business interests held over the public domain and by concentrating decision-making in the hands of experts in the Interior Department. He argued that environmentalism can and must coexist with positive economic development.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Hood River, Oregon on August 25, 1931, Andrus was the middle of three children of Hal Stephen and Dorothy May (Johnson) Andrus, with older brother Steve and younger sister Margaret.

The need for the college arose as a result of a change in the Government's education policy. The multipurpose scheme was given up in favor of the Junior college systems\nThe interest shown by the chief Minister Mr. Vengal Rao, led to the grant of a piece of land in Ranga Reddy District and LFJC began to take shape.

He is the club's longest serving manager, lasting a decade in the manager's seat between November 1958 and November 1968. He took charge of Leicester for a club record 508 matches, after making 111 appearances for the club as a player.\nHe was manager of the Leicester side nicknamed the 'Ice Kings', which chased the double in 1962\u201363.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nGillies played for R.A.F. Weeton, Bolton Wanderers and Leicester City, making a total of 248 appearances in the Football League.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\n\n\n=== Leicester City ===\nGillies took a brief break from football after finishing his playing career at Leicester in the summer of 1955, but returned to the club less than a year later to become part of the club's coaching staff under Dave Halliday in April 1956, before being made the club's manager on 1 November 1958.In 1959, Gillies signed then-unknown 22-year-old goalkeeper Gordon Banks from Chesterfield for just \u00a37,000. He also signed club stalwarts Dave Gibson, Mike Stringfellow, Lenny Glover and Derek Dougan. He was known as a fine nurturer and scout of young talent, bringing along Peter Shilton, Frank McLintock, Graham Cross and David Nish.\nGillies took over the Foxes on 8 November 1958 as they sat bottom of the First Division and amidst fan unrest after his predecessor David Halliday had recently sold star striker Arthur Rowley to Shrewsbury Town. He brought in Bert Johnson as his assistant and head scout and the pair would embark in arguably the most successful period in the club's history.Gillies managed to keep Leicester up in his opening season, but could only manage the signings of Albert Cheesebrough and Gordon Banks (originally signed as back-up) in the summer of 1959, as the majority of his transfer bids were rebuffed, while scouting missions to watch the young Huddersfield Town striker Denis Law saw him give an unimpressive performance on two separate occasions and Leicester again struggled at the beginning of the season. However, an injury to first choice goalkeeper Dave MacLaren in September, saw Gordon Banks come on for his replacement and within a month he had established himself as the first choice goalkeeper. Gillies also promoted a young Frank McLintock from the reserves around the same time and although both players made an instant impact and were being touted as stars of the future, it took until December until Leicester's season picked up, eventually finishing in a very respectable 12th position.Leicester continued to improve under Gillies and the following season, they finished 6th in the league, the club's highest league finish since finishing league runners-up in 1928\u201329. The club also reached the 1961 FA Cup Final in which they faced a Tottenham Hotspur side chasing the double. Gillies made the sensational decision to drop striker Ken Leek who had scored in every round of Leicester's cup run due to his drinking problems. In the final itself Len Chalmers received an injury early in the game and had to hobble for the remaining 70 minutes or so, meaning Leicester were effectively down to 10 men and Leicester went down 2\u20130 as Tottenham clinched the double. Though this did mean Leicester had qualified for Europe for the first time in their history. The club were knocked out in the first round of the European Cup Winners' Cup though 3\u20131 on aggregate to eventual winners Atl\u00e9tico Madrid after beating Glenavon 7\u20133 on aggregate in the Preliminary Round.\nTwo seasons later, in 1962\u201363, in what is considered Gillies' and often the club's peak, Leicester remarkably chased the double themselves, not only did they reach the FA Cup Final but they also sat top of the First Division with just 5 games to go. The worst winter for 2 decades led to a plethora of games being postponed. During these postponements Leicester quietly climbed the league in a then club record 18 match unbeaten run earning them the nickname in the national press of \"

The structure, which was briefly the headquarters of Carshalton Urban District Council before becoming a public library, is a Grade II listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing a significant increase in population, largely associated with the growing importance of the area as a residential suburb of London, the area became an urban district in 1894. The new urban district council initially rented premises in the High Street. In the early 20th century, civic officials, led by the clerk to the council, Charles Lovelock, launched an initiative to raise funds for purpose-built council offices. The site they selected, on the west side of The Square, had formed part of the grounds of All Saints Church.The foundation stone for the new building was laid by the chairman of the council, Councillor C. W. Edwards, on 21 December 1906. It was designed by R. Frank Atkinson and W. Willis Gale in the Baroque Revival style, built in red and blue bricks with stone dressings at a cost of \u00a32,500 and was completed in 1908. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with five bays facing onto The Square; the central section bay featured a doorway flanked by banded pilasters supporting an entablature, which was broken by a large keystone, and an open segmental pediment. There was a casement window flanked by stone scrolls on the first floor. The other bays were fenestrated by cross-windows on the ground floor and by casement windows on the first floor. At roof level, there was a modillioned cornice.Within a few years the civic leaders decided that the building was too small and Lovelock persuaded the lord of the manor, Blake Taylor, to sell land including The Grove and the rest of the area around the upper ponds to the council. By the mid-1920s, the council had relocated its offices to The Grove. The old council offices in The Square were converted for use as a library and a museum and were re-opened by the former member of parliament, Sir Thomas Worsfold, in January 1931. The museum failed to attract sufficient visitors and the collection was put into storage two years later. However, the building continued to serve the people of Carshalton as a public library until December 2012 when the library service relocated to the Westcroft Centre. The building then became a nursery but that also closed in 2020.\n\n\n== References =="

The league is in the third tier of American soccer and began play in 2019. NISA initially used a fall-to-spring season format with a winter break but have switched to spring-to-fall which is more common in the United States.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== League beginnings ===\n\nOn June 6, 2017, it was announced that the newly formed National Independent Soccer Association would begin play in 2018 targeting an initial 8 to 10 teams, later revised to 8 to 12 teams. Initially, the league outlined plans to introduce a promotion/relegation system, once they reach their goal of 24 teams, the first in US professional soccer and in doing so act as a feeder league to the North American Soccer League (NASL); however, the NASL ceased operations prior to those plans being implemented.\nOn February 13, 2018, NISA co-founder Jack Cummins died suddenly. On May 17, 2018, NISA co-founder Peter Wilt left the NISA to help start up Forward Madison FC in Madison, Wisconsin in USL League One.

On February 16, 2019, NISA was provisionally sanctioned as a Division III league by the United States Soccer Federation. In May 2019, it was announced that clubs were not happy with the silence from the league and that Bob Watkins was no longer the President of NISA and that John Prutch had taken the helm as commissioner. During this same timeframe, the league's start date was pushed back from August 2019 to a targeted September start date.On June 10, 2019, it became known that both Miami FC and California United Strikers FC were approved at the recent board of governors meeting to join NISA, while the previously identified club in Central Florida would play in Baton Rouge, Louisiana instead of Daytona Beach, Florida.

On August 15, 2019, the league officially announced the addition of Oakland Roots for the 2019 season and Chattanooga FC, Detroit City FC, and Michigan Stars FC for early 2020.The inaugural season began on August 31, 2019, with a 3\u20133 draw for Oakland Roots SC and California United Strikers FC in Oakland. On April 27, 2020, following previous postponements, the remainder of the 2019\u201320 season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.On September 10, 2020, the league announced that one of the original co-founders of the league, Peter Wilt, would be rejoining the league in a club operations capacity by attempting to establish a club in Chicago. On September 15, 2020, one of the founding teams, Oakland Roots, announced that they were leaving the league to join the USL Championship a league in the second division of professional soccer.\n\n\n=== Development of the amateur and semi-professional game ===\nOn April 27, 2020, NISA revealed a new tournament called the NISA Independent Cup that would have member teams face off against high quality amateur and independent professional sides in a regional format.

The partnership is set to provide a pathway to professional status for both clubs and players, while also allowing two GCPL teams to qualify for future editions of the Independent Cup based on league play. This was expanded to include the Midwest Premier League and Eastern Premier Soccer League on September 3 and 4, 2020, respectively. On November 23, NISA announced a fourth agreement with the Mountain Premier League.On September 17, 2020, the league announced that it was establishing a full-year amateur league, the NISA Nation, that would serve as an incubator for amateur and semi-professional clubs that wish to move into NISA's professional league.

Founded in 1869, today it has more than 2,000 members, drawn from the city's professional and business community. The club's main building is designated as a Category I historic building by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Northern Club was founded by a group of prominent professional and business men in 1867 when the idea of gentlemen's clubs was at its peak throughout the British Empire. The club's founders agreed to purchase a handsome quarrystone building overlooking Albert Barracks in Princes Street.The four-storey building, a high-rise in its own time, was originally designed as a hotel and was built on the first section sold at Auckland's inaugural land sale in 1841.  Following the purchase, architect Edward Ramsey was commissioned to rearrange the hotel's internal rooms for use by the club's 120 founding members.\nIn 1991, the club voted to admit women and today has a membership of both men and women. Membership of the Northern Club attracted many leaders of the Auckland community, and the club has played an active and sometimes pivotal role in the history of New Zealand's largest city. In 2010, the Northern Club absorbed the Auckland Club, adding over NZ$3 million in assets to the club, and some 250 members.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Northern Club building has a long history of association with Auckland's social elite. Built in 1867 as the Royal Hotel, it became a gentlemen's club two years later. Originally designed by Edward Mahoney, the three-storeyed building was located in a prestigious part of the settlement, close to the former Government House and provincial council. It was erected in a fashionable Italianate style, the brick structure being rendered externally to appear masonry-built. As the Royal, it replaced a timber structure of the same name and gained a reputation as the grandest establishment in town. Early tenants included the provincial government, which rented rooms as offices, and the Auckland Institute and Museum, while part of the first floor was a British Army officers' mess used by soldiers from the nearby Albert Barracks.\nThe Northern Club purchased the building in 1869, the club having been formed earlier in the year. Gentlemen's clubs developed in nineteenth-century Britain, enabling social and business networks to be maintained. Early members of the club included a future Prime Minister, Julius Vogel (1835\u20131899), and prominent businessmen such as Thomas Russell (1830\u20131904) and David Nathan (1816\u20131886). Governors of the colony were among those invited as guests, reinforcing the exclusivity of the organisation. The club refurbished the interior, and in the process reinforced social divisions through the building's layout. Service rooms for employees were located in the basement and members' reception rooms on the ground floor, while personal servants were not allowed in the upper chambers, although exceptions were made for governors. \nExpansion to the facilities generally occurred during periods of economic boom. A new dining room and fifteen bedrooms were constructed at the rear of the building in 1883\u20131884, and accommodation for residential staff was added in the 1920s. Exclusively male in its membership for over 120 years, facilities for women were introduced only gradually. The first female member was admitted in 1990, shortly after the earliest woman after-dinner speaker, the Minister of Finance Ruth Richardson, who addressed the club in 1989. Today nearly 20 per cent of members are female.\nThe Northern Club building is significant as one of the oldest surviving clubs in Auckland, and one of the city's oldest hotels.

Born in St. Helens, Lancashire, after retirement from competition he was a businessman based in the Isle of Man. He raced several brands of motorcycle: Norton, Gilera, BMW, NSU and Benelli.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\nAfter reaching the status of Team Sergeant in the Royal Signals Motorcycle Display Team, The White Helmets, Duke was a prominent figure in racing in the 1950s, winning six world championships and six Isle of Man TT races. First entering the Isle of Man Manx Grand Prix in 1948, he retired after four laps of the Junior race. He came to prominence after the 1949 events, finishing second in the Junior race, after remounting due to a spill, and winning the Senior race with a record lap and race-average speeds. He also won the 1949 Senior Clubmans TT. He signed to the Norton works team for the 1950 TT, finishing second in the Junior TT and breaking both lap and race records in the Senior TT.\nAfter winning three World Championships for Norton, he moved abroad to Italian motorcycle manufacturer, Gilera in 1953. With Gilera, he had a string of three consecutive 500 cc world championships. His support for a riders' strike demanding more start money led the FIM to suspend him for six months, dashing any hopes for a fourth consecutive title. For 1953 he joined the sports car racing team of Aston Martin (Feltham, Middlesex) to race the DB3. Teamed with Peter Collins, the pair led the 12 Hours of Sebring until Duke's accident and resulting DNF. In 1955 he was declared the first rider to lap the Isle of Man TT course at 100 mph, though this was later corrected to 99.97. As a consequence the official first 100 mph lap is credited to Bob McIntyre, also on a Gilera, in 1957. Duke was a non-starter because of injury. His final race was the 1959 Nations Grand Prix.\nDuke briefly dabbled in Formula One, entering the 1961 German Grand Prix in a private Cooper-Climax. Although forced to withdraw from that event as his car was not yet ready, he did race in the non-championship Kanonloppet at Karlskoga two weeks later.In 1963, he formed a racing team \u2013 Scuderia Duke, with riders Derek Minter and John Hartle \u2013 to race the 1957 Gileras against Mike Hailwood riding the MV Agusta.During 1964, Duke was appointed Competition Manager for Royal Enfield motorcycles, helping to develop their new GP250 clubman's-category production-volume road racer.For the 1965 International Six Days Trial held on the Isle of Man, Duke was instrumental in helping to devise the 1,000-mile course and sections held on an island measuring approximately 30 miles long by 10 miles wide, particularly using tracks which would be unavailable in mainland UK due to restrictive legislation, a problem which did not arise on self-governing Isle of Man. Additionally, the island had hotels easily able to cater for the visiting teams, followers and spectators with a traditional goodwill and enthusiasm towards motorcycle sport. Duke acted as Clerk of the Course to the ACU, the governing body of motorcycle sport in Great Britain including the Isle of Man, which interacted with the FIM international organisation.In 1967, Duke acted as entrant for the class-winning Triumph Bonneville ridden by John Hartle in the 750 cc capacity section of the newly introduced for 1967 Production class, which required racing machines to be based on roadsters, complying with controlled specifications using selected adaptations only, available from the manufacturers as part-numbered inventory.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDuke was the most famous rider to adopt one-piece leathers - he had enlisted his local tailor, Frank Barker, to make the first of his now famous one-piece race suits. Duke had previously used a one-piece lining under his two-piece leather racing suit, to facilitate easy movement, for which he received \"
"Computer_graphics_lighting| 3D rendering| Lighting| Shading| ","Computer graphics lighting is the collection of techniques used to simulate light in computer graphics scenes. While lighting techniques offer flexibility in the level of detail and functionality available, they also operate at different levels of computational demand and complexity. Graphics artists can choose from a variety of light sources, models, shading techniques, and effects to suit the needs of each application.\n\n\n== Light sources ==\nLight sources allow for different ways to introduce light into graphics scenes.\n\n\n=== Point ===\nPoint sources emit light from a single point in all directions, with the intensity of the light decreasing with distance. An example of a point source is a standalone light bulb.\n\n\n=== Directional ===\nA directional source (or distant source) uniformly lights a scene from one direction. Unlike a point source, the intensity of light produced by a directional source does not change with distance, as the directional source is treated as though it is extremely far away from the scene. An example of a directional source is sunlight.\n\n\n=== Spotlight ===\nA spotlight produces a directed cone of light. The light becomes more intense closer to the spotlight source and to the center of the light cone. An example of a spotlight is a flashlight.\n\n\n=== Ambient ===\nAmbient light sources illuminate objects even when no other light source is present. The intensity of ambient light is independent of direction, distance, and other objects, meaning the effect is completely uniform throughout the scene. This source ensures that objects are visible even in complete darkness.\n\n\n=== Lightwarp ===\nA lightwarp is a technique of which an object in the geometrical world refracts light based on the direction and intensity of the light. The light is then warped using an ambient diffuse term with a range of the color spectrum. The light then may be reflectively scattered to produce a higher depth of field, and refracted. The technique is used to produce a unique rendering style and can be used to limit overexposure of objects. Games such as Team Fortress 2 use the rendering technique to create a cartoon cel shaded stylized look.\n\n\n== Lighting interactions ==\nIn computer graphics, light usually consists of multiple components. The overall effect of a light source on an object is determined by the combination of the object's interactions with these components. The three primary lighting components (and subsequent interaction types) are diffuse, ambient, and specular.\n\n\n=== Diffuse ===\nDiffuse lighting (or diffuse reflection) is the direct illumination of an object by an even amount of light interacting with a light-scattering surface. After light strikes an object, it is reflected as a function of the surface properties of the object as well as the angle of incoming light. This interaction is the primary contributor to the object's brightness and forms the basis for its color.\n\n\n=== Ambient ===\nAs ambient light is directionless, it interacts uniformly across all surfaces, with its intensity determined by the strength of the ambient light sources and the properties of objects' surface materials, namely their ambient reflection coefficients.\n\n\n=== Specular ===\nThe specular lighting component gives objects shine and highlights. This is distinct from mirror effects because other objects in the environment are not visible in these reflections. Instead, specular lighting creates bright spots on objects based on the intensity of the specular lighting component and the specular reflection coefficient of the surface.\n\n\n== Illumination models ==\nLighting models are used to replicate lighting effects in rendered environments where light is approximated based on the physics of light. Without lighting models, replicating lighting effects as they occur in the natural world would require more processing power than is practical for computer graphics. This lighting, or illumination model's purpose is to compute the color of every pixel or the amount of light reflected for different surfaces in the scene. There are two main illumination models, object oriented lighting and global illumination. They differ in that object oriented lighting considers each object individually, whereas global illumination maps how light interacts between objects. Currently, researchers are developing global illumination techniques to more accurately replicate how light interacts with its environment.\n\n\n=== Object oriented lighting ===\nObject oriented lighting, also known as local illumination, is defined by mapping a single light source to a single object. This technique is fast to compute, but often is an incomplete approximation of how light would behave in the scene in reality. It is often approximated by summing a combination of specular, diffuse, and ambient light of a specific object. The two predominant local illumination models are the Phong and the Blinn-Phong illumination models.\n\n\n==== Phong illumination model ====\n\nOne of the most common shading models is the Phong model. The Phong model assumes that the intensity of each pixel is the sum of the intensity due to diffuse, specular, and ambient lighting. This model takes into account the location of a viewer to determine specular light using the angle of light reflecting off an object. The cosine of the angle is taken and raised to a power decided by the designer. With this, the designer can decide how wide a highlight they want on an object; because of this, the power is called the shininess value. The shininess value is determined by the roughness of the surface where a mirror would have a value of infinity and the roughest surface might have a value of one. This model creates a more realistic looking white highlight based on the perspective of the viewer.\n\n\n==== Blinn-Phong illumination model ====\n\nThe Blinn-Phong illumination model is similar to the Phong model as it uses specular light to create a highlight on an object based on its shininess. The Blinn-Phong differs from the Phong illumination model, as the Blinn-Phong model uses the vector normal to the surface of the object and halfway between the light source and the viewer. This model is used in order to have accurate specular lighting and reduced computation time. The process takes less time because finding the reflected light vector's direction is a more involved computation than calculating the halfway normal vector. While this is similar to the Phong model, it produces different visual results, and the specular reflection exponent or shininess might need modification in order to produce a similar specular reflection.\n\n\n=== Global illumination ===\n\nGlobal illumination differs from local illumination because it calculates light as it would travel throughout the entire scene. This lighting is based more heavily in physics and optics, with light rays scattering, reflecting, and indefinitely bouncing throughout the scene. There is still active research being done on global illumination as it requires more computational power than local illumination.\n\n\n==== Ray tracing ====\n\nLight sources emit rays that interact with various surfaces through absorption, reflection, or refraction. An observer of the scene would see any light source that reaches their eyes; a ray that does not reach the observer goes unnoticed. It is possible to simulate this by having all of the light sources emit rays and then compute how of each of them interact with all of the objects in the scene. However, this process is inefficient as most of the light rays would not reach the observer and would waste processing time. Ray tracing solves this problem by reversing the process, instead sending view rays from the observer and calculating how they interact until they reach a light source. Although this way more effectively uses processing time and produces a light simulation closely imitating natural lighting, ray tracing still has high computation costs due to the high amounts of light that reach viewer's eyes.\n\n\n==== Radiosity ====\n\nRadiosity takes into account the energy given off by surrounding objects and the light source. Unlike ray tracing, which is dependent on the position and orientation of the observer, radiosity lighting is independent of view position. Radiosity requires more computational power than ray tracing, but can be more useful for scenes with static lighting because it would only have to be computed once. The surfaces of a scene can be divided into a large amount of patches; each patch radiates some light and affects the other patches, then a large set of equations needs to be solved simultaneously in order to get the final radiosity of each patch.\n\n\n==== Photon mapping ====\n\nPhoton mapping was created as a two-pass global illumination algorithm that is more efficient than raytracing. It is the basic principle of tracking photons released from a light source through a series of stages. The first pass includes the photons being released from a light source and bouncing off their first object; this map of where are the photons are located is then recorded. The photon map contains both the position and direction of each photon which either bounce or are absorbed. The second pass happens with rendering where the reflections are calculated for different surfaces. In this process, the photon map is decoupled from the geometry of the scene, meaning rendering can be calculated separately. It is a useful technique because it can simulate caustics, and pre-processing steps do not need to be repeated if the view or objects change.\n\n\n== Polygonal shading ==\n\nPolygonal shading is part of the rasterization process where 3D models are drawn as 2D pixel images. Shading applies a lighting model, in conjunction with the geometric attributes of the 3D model, to determine how lighting should be represented at each fragment (or pixel) of the resulting image. The polygons of the 3D model store the geometric values needed for the shading process. This information includes vertex positional values and surface normals, but can contain optional data, such as texture and bump maps.\n\n\n=== Flat shading ===\nFlat shading is a simple shading model with a uniform application of lighting and color per polygon. The color and normal of one vertex is used to calculate the shading of the entire polygon. Flat shading is inexpensive, as lighting for each polygon only needs to be calculated once per render.\n\n\n=== Gouraud shading ===\nGouraud shading is a type of interpolated shading where the values inside of each polygon are a blend of its vertex values. Each vertex is given its own normal consisting of the average of the surface normals of the surrounding polygons. The lighting and shading at that vertex is then calculated using the average normal and the lighting model of choice. This process is repeated for all the vertices in the 3D model. Next, the shading of the edges between the vertices is calculated by interpolating between the vertex values. Finally, the shading inside of the polygon is calculated as an interpolation of the surrounding edge values. Gouraud shading generates a smooth lighting effect across the 3D model's surface.\n\n\n=== Phong shading ===\nPhong shading, similar to Gouraud shading, is another type of interpolative shading that blends between vertex values to shade polygons. The key difference between the two is that Phong shading interpolates the vertex normal values over the whole polygon before it calculates its shading. This contrasts with Gouraud shading which interpolates the already shaded vertex values over the whole polygon. Once Phong shading has calculated the normal of a fragment (pixel) inside the polygon, it can then apply a lighting model, shading that fragment. This process is repeated until each polygon of the 3D model is shaded.\n\n\n== Lighting effects ==\n\n\n=== Caustics ===\n\nCaustics are a lighting effect of reflected and refracted light moving through a medium. They appear as ribbons of concentrated light and are often seen when looking at bodies of water or glass. Caustics can be implemented in 3D graphics by blending a caustic texture map with the texture map of the affected objects. The caustics texture can either be a static image that is animated to mimic the effects of caustics, or a Real-time calculation of caustics onto a blank image. The latter is more complicated and requires backwards ray tracing to simulate photons moving through the environment of the 3D render. In a photon mapping illumination model, Monte Carlo sampling is used in conjunction with the ray tracing to compute the intensity of light caused by the caustics.\n\n\n=== Reflection mapping ===\n\nReflection mapping (also known as environment mapping) is a technique which uses 2D environment maps to create the effect of reflectivity without using ray tracing. Since the appearances of reflective objects depend on the relative positions of the viewers, the objects, and the surrounding environments, graphics algorithms produce reflection vectors to determine how to color the objects based on these elements. Using 2D environment maps rather than fully rendered, 3D objects to represent surroundings, reflections on objects can be determined using simple, computationally inexpensive algorithms.\n\n\n=== Particle systems ===\n\nParticle systems use collections of small particles to model chaotic, high-complexity events, such as fire, moving liquids, explosions, and moving hair. Particles which make up the complex animation are distributed by an emitter, which gives each particle its properties, such as speed, lifespan, and color. Over time, these particles may move, change color, or vary other properties, depending on the effect. Typically, particle systems incorporate randomness, such as in the initial properties the emitter gives each particle, to make the effect realistic and non-uniform.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPer-pixel lighting\nComputer graphics\n\n\n== References =="

"Thousand_Islands_%E2%80%93_Frontenac_Arch| Biosphere reserves of Canada| Thousand Islands| Geology of Ontario| Geology of New York (state)| ","The Thousand Islands \u2013 Frontenac Arch region or the Frontenac Axis is an exposed strip of Precambrian rock in Canada and the United States that links the Canadian Shield from Algonquin Park with the Adirondack Mountain region in New York, an extension of the Laurentian mountains of Qu\u00e9bec. The Algonquin to Adirondacks region, which includes the Frontenac Axis or Arch, is a critical linkage for biodiversity and resilience, and one with important conservation potential. The axis separates the St. Lawrence Lowlands and the Great Lakes Lowlands. It has many distinctive plant and animal species. It is one of four ecoregions of the Mixedwood Plains.\nThe Thousand Islands in the Saint Lawrence River have a distinctive flora and fauna and are a part of the biological corridor.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nThe bedrock is mostly gneiss, granite, and marble, more than a billion years old. The Frontenac terrain is the youngest of the Ontario portions of the arch, dated at 1.2 billion years old. These rocks were once part of a large mountain chain of the ancient supercontinent of Rodinia. There is also a meteor crater near Holleford, where the shield meets the limestone plains of southeastern Ontario.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe area is distinctive for having tree species typically found further south, and reaching their northern limits. One example is pitch pine (Pinus rigida). Shallow soils and recurring fire have also produced unusual fire barren communities. These provide habitat for rare plants, such as bear oak (Quercus ilicifolia) and deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum), as well as rare animals, such as the five-lined skink (Plestiodon fasciatus) and gray rat snake (Pantherophis spiloides). There is high bird diversity, including the cerulean warbler, considered nationally endangered owing to the destruction of forests. Although the most important factor producing the fauna and flora is likely the bed rock, the moderating effect of the Great Lakes may also be factor. Also, some northern species extend their range south, drawn by the rugged granite landscapes of the Canadian Shield.\nThe basic ecosystem type of the area is temperate deciduous forest. The area has a long history of logging, which has depleted these forests of larger trees.  Settlement tends to have occurred in the areas of deeper soil, and fire has particularly influenced the uplands. Reference to the forest descriptions of early surveyors has documented decline in species such as hemlock, which were preferentially removed for leather tanning. Criteria for restoring these forests have been established, and include increased tree size, spring ephemeral abundance, and coarse woody debris. Pollen cores from Lanark County provide information about longer term trends in forest cover.There is a wide array of wetlands, ranging from larger marshes along the St. Lawrence river, to smaller marshes and bogs along water courses, and large numbers of beaver ponds.  The cycles in vegetation in beaver ponds contribute to further wetland diversity; depending upon the amount of beaver activity, there may be open water, marsh, wet meadows or shrub thickets. Some lakes in the area, such as Bob's Lake, also support uncommon species of turtles, such as the map turtles and Blanding's turtles. Where there is marble bedrock, or other sources of calcium, fens may arise.  These often have unusual calcium dependent wetland plants.A southern portion of this region was designated a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2002, the Frontenac Arch Biosphere Reserve. Within this biosphere reserve is the relatively small St. Lawrence Islands National Park. Although it is small, it has many Frontenac Arch species mentioned above, including deerberry, Blanding's turtle, and five-lined skinks. Further north, there is still a large gap in the ecological link to Algonquin Park. In this gap are smaller parks such as Frontenac Provincial Park and Bon Echo Provincial Park.\n\n\n== References =="

"Rodney_Smith_(running_back)| 1996 births| Living people| People from Jonesboro, Georgia| Sportspeople from the Atlanta metropolitan area| Players of American football from Georgia (U.S. state)| American football running backs| Minnesota Golden Gophers football players| Carolina Panthers players| Tennessee Titans players| Detroit Lions players| ","Rodney Smith (born February 28, 1996) is an American football running back who is a free agent. He played college football at Minnesota, and signed with the Carolina Panthers as an undrafted free agent in 2020.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nA 2014 graduate of Mundy's Mill High School, Smith played both football and baseball. As a senior, Smith helped lead Mundy's Mill to its best record to date, 8\u20135, while rushing for 261 times for 2,201 yards and earning first team all-state honors. As a baseball player, Smith finished his career by being named the Region 4-AAAAA Player of the Year in Georgia.As a recruit, Smith was ranked a three-star prospect and the 71st best running back in the 2014 recruiting class by 247Sports. Smith was also rated as a three-star prospect by ESPN and Scout, while Rivals listed him as a two-star prospect. Smith committed to Minnesota over offers from East Carolina, Southern Miss, and others, citing the prestige of a Big Ten degree and Minnesota's physical rushing-based offense as key reasons for his decision.\n\n\n== College career ==\n\n\n=== Freshman season ===\nAfter redshirting during the 2014 season, Smith played in 12 of Minnesota's 13 games as a redshirt freshman during the 2015 season, rushing 157 times for 670 yards and 2 touchdowns.\n\n\n=== Sophomore season ===\nDuring his sophomore campaign, Smith took the lead role in the Gophers' backfield, starting the majority of games while splitting the overall workload with fellow sophomore Shannon Brooks. During the regular season, Smith rushed for 1,084 yards and 15 touchdowns, earning third-team all-Big Ten honors for his efforts. The 15 touchdowns would also rank, at the time, as the third most rushing touchdowns in a single season for a Gophers running back. The Gophers would qualify for the Holiday Bowl, taking on Washingston State. Smith starred in the game, leading all rushers with 17 carries for 74 yards and added a touchdown, which earned him the offensive MVP award for the Holiday Bowl.\n\n\n=== Junior season ===\nSmith continued to be the lead back for the Gophers during the 2017 season, sharing carries with Shannon Brooks and Kobe McCrary, but saw his production decrease as the production of the offense as a whole decreased. This was due to many factors, mainly a first-year head coach in P. J. Fleck, a first-year offensive coordinator in Kirk Ciarrocca, as well as inconsistent QB play after the departure of 3-year starter Mitch Leidner. Still, Smith ran for 977 yards, which was 7th in the Big Ten, as well as 3 touchdowns that earned him an all-Big Ten honorable mention from the coaches and media.\n\n\n=== (Redshirt) Senior season ===\nSmith started off his senior campaign in 2018 with a bang, rushing for a (then) career-high 156 yards against New Mexico State in a 48\u201310 victory. However, in the next game against Fresno State, on just the third play from scrimmage, Smith tore his ACL on his left knee.\nThis injury kept him out for the remainder of the season. Smith was then granted a 6th year of eligibility by the NCAA, having already redshirted once during his first year on campus.\n\n\n=== Senior season ===\nAs a sixth year senior, Smith once again emerged as the primary ball carrier, while sophomore Mohamed Ibrahim and fellow senior Shannon Brooks also shared the workload. After a relatively slow start in the Gophers' three non-conference games, Smith ran for over 100 yards and at least 1 touchdown in each of the first five conference games, including a career-high 211 yard performance on just 24 carries against Illinois. Smith finished the season with a career-high 1,163 rushing yards. That number was good for 3rd in the Big Ten, behind only J. K. Dobbins and Jonathan Taylor. He also ran for 8 touchdowns, and was awarded all-Big Ten 2nd team honors by both the coaches and media. Smith left Minnesota 2nd all-time in rushing, with 4,125 yards, 6th all-time in rushing touchdowns, with 29, 2nd all-time in yards from scrimmage, with 4,646, and 1st all-time in all-purpose yards, with 5,444.\n\n\n=== Statistics ===\nSmith's statistics are as follows:\n\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n\n=== Carolina Panthers ===\nAfter not being selected in the 2020 NFL Draft, Smith signed with the Carolina Panthers as an undrafted free agent. He was waived on August 1, 2020. He was signed to the practice squad on October 12, 2020. He was promoted to the active roster on November 14, 2020. In Week 10 of the 2020 season, he made his NFL debut against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and had three carries for 13 rushing yards. In the final game of the 2020 NFL season, he scored his first career rushing touchdown against Carolina's division rivals New Orleans Saints in a 33-7 loss.On August 31, 2021, Smith was waived by the Panthers, and re-signed to the practice squad the next day. He was released on October 11.\n\n\n=== Tennessee Titans ===\nSmith signed with the Tennessee Titans' practice squad on November 23, 2021. He was released on December 8.\n\n\n=== Detroit Lions ===\nOn December 11, 2021, Smith was signed to the Detroit Lions practice squad.

The current world number one is Paul Coll of New Zealand.\n\n\n== PSA ranking policy ==\nPlayers competing in PSA tournaments earn ranking points according to how far they get in the draw. The points available depend on the prize money and the draw size. The monthly rankings (issued on the 1st of the month) are used in selecting entries to tournaments and in determining the seeds.\nThe total number of points a player earns in the previous twelve months is divided by the number of tournaments played (a minimum divisor of ten is used) to give a ranking average. Where a player has played more than 10 tournaments the best scores may be selected (i.e. the lowest are not included) according to the Averaging Formula. (See table below.)\nFor example, a player who has competed in 14 events will have his best 11 scores used.  These will be accumulated and divided by 11.\nPlayers competing in PSA World Tour Events earn ranking points according to the prize money, classification of the event, and the final position in the draw the player reaches.\n\n\n=== Divisor ===\nA divisor is selected based on the number of tournaments played during the year as shown in the table below (the minimum divisor is ten).

Cavendish-Bentinck and Ruth Cavendish-Bentinck, grandson of George Cavendish-Bentinck, and great-grandson of Major General Lord Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck, fourth son of the 3rd Duke of Portland, the young Cavendish-Bentinck was educated at Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, passing out in 1910. He was commissioned into the 60th Rifles and was posted to Malta and British India before seeing active service in the European theatre of the First World War, which left him severely wounded. He then took up a posting as assistant adjutant at the Royal Military College. After the war, his main sphere of activity was in East Africa, where he served as Private Secretary to the Governor of Uganda (1925\u20131927), Chairman of the Agricultural Production and Settlement Board for Kenya (1939\u20131945), Timber Controller for East Africa (1940\u20131945), Member of the Government of Kenya for Agriculture and Natural Resources (1945\u20131955), and Speaker of the Kenya Legislative Council (1955\u20131960).He was a Delegate to the Delhi Conference of 1940.He became the heir presumptive of his third cousin, William Cavendish-Bentinck, 7th Duke of Portland, after the deaths of the latter's brother Lord (Francis) Morven Dallas Cavendish-Bentinck (1900-1950) and half-uncle Charles Cavendish-Bentinck (1868-1956). The previous duke's lands came to stay with the descendants of the 7th Duke and never passed to the distantly related 8th Duke in 1977.  In the early 20th century the usual tail male arrangement of the entailed largest landholdings became deprecated by powerful statutes as it tended to leave noble daughters with little. The 6th Duke, before dying in 1943 broke the entails and set up a trust which saw as his son the future 7th Duke left no son Welbeck Abbey and other large holdings would go to his granddaughters in turn including Lady Anne Cavendish-Bentinck. No viable family court case could ensue as the fee tail was abolished as a recognised entity in the abstract (in law) under the Law of Property Act 1925 and any remote, entailed beneficiaries could be disinherited under the Settled Land Acts. The new Duke of Portland continued to live in Nairobi.\nElizabeth II shares an ancestor, in the 3rd Duke of Portland, through her maternal grandmother Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck, and is thus a third cousin, once removed, of the 8th Duke of Portland.\n\n\n== Family ==\nIn 1912, he married Wentworth Frances (d 1964), daughter of William James Hope-Johnston.

Often called a problem solving set, Einstellung refers to a person's predisposition to solve a given problem in a specific manner even though better or more appropriate methods of solving the problem exist.\nThe Einstellung effect is the negative effect of previous experience when solving new problems. The Einstellung effect has been tested experimentally in many different contexts.\nThe most famous example (which led to the coining of the term by Abraham S. Luchins and Edith Hirsch Luchins) is the Luchins water jar experiment, in which subjects were asked to solve a series of water jar problems. After solving many problems which had the same solution, subjects applied the same solution to later problems even though a simpler solution existed (Luchins, 1942). Other experiments on the Einstellung effect can be found in The Effect of Einstellung on Compositional Processes and Rigidity of Behavior, A Variational Approach to the Effect of Einstellung.\n\n\n== Background ==\nEinstellung literally means \"

The operation and after-care required the co-operation of more than 100 volunteers and the resulting procedure was successful and widely publicised. Karen became a favorite with zoo visitors, surviving more than 25 years.\nKaren is the subject of a book by Georgeanne Irvine titled Karen\u2019s Heart: The True Story of a Brave Baby Orangutan, published by Blue Sneaker Press in 2018.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWild Sumatran orangutans are critically endangered.

It represents regional consensus on what African states should do in the areas of prevention, criminalization, international cooperation and asset recovery. Going beyond other similar conventions, the AUCPCC calls for the eradication of corruption in the private and public sector. The Convention covers a wide range of offences including bribery (domestic or foreign), diversion of property by public officials, trading in influence, illicit enrichment, money laundering and concealment of property and primarily consists of mandatory provisions. It also obliges the signatories to introduce open and converted investigations against corruption. Those measures attracted criticism in the Journal of African Law, where Peter Schroth argued that the convention disregards other aspects of the rule of law, like e.g. data protection and the presumption of innocence.In 2007, it was reported that the following nine countries had legal gaps relating to this Convention and United Nations Convention against Corruption.: Algeria, Burundi, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Togo, and Uganda.\nAs at 1 January 2020, the treaty was ratified by 43 States and signed by 49.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"

It is endemic to the eastern and southeastern United States. Its natural habitat is woodland and open areas near forest rivers and streams.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe sparkling jewelwing is one of the smallest damselflies in its family with a total length of 37 to 50 millimetres (1.5 to 2.0 in). The thorax and the long slender abdomen are metallic bluish-green and the eyes are brown. In males the end fifth of each wing is black, with a straight line separating the dark section from the transparent hyaline remainder of the wing. Females are a slightly more bronzy-green. Their wings may be similar to those of the male but less clearly defined, or only the hind wings may be tipped with black, or the wings may be entirely clear. There is usually a small white pterostigma near the tip of the wings. Immature adults have reddish eyes and generally duller colouring.The male sparkling jewelwing has fore-wings and hind wings that do not differ in size by more than 2 millimetres (0.08 in). The apex of both pairs of wing has a black band that terminates in a straight line distal to the nodus. The sternum of the tenth abdominal segment is black. These features distinguish this species from the others in its genus that share its range.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThe sparkling jewelwing is found in the eastern and southeastern United States. Its range extends from New England to Louisiana and parts of Texas, mainly on the Atlantic coastal plain. Its typical habitat is sandy forest streams, particularly acidic ones, with fast-flowing water in locations with plentiful riverside vegetation.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe sparkling jewelwing is on the wing between May and September in New Jersey but between February and November in Florida. Both males and females can often be seen together near breeding sites, with males patrolling small territories, circling and chasing off rivals. When a female is present, ritualised courtship flights precede copulation which lasts for about two minutes. After this, the female walks down the stem of an emergent plant and spends about fifteen minutes underwater, laying a batch of several hundred eggs before returning to the surface.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNatureServe. 2015.

His parents were Austrian Jewish immigrants. Gilman graduated from Middletown High School in Middletown, New York, in 1941 and received a B.S. from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946. He also earned an LL.B. from New York Law School. Gilman served in the United States Army Air Corps from 1942 until 1945 during World War II. During that conflict, he flew 35 missions over Japan, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with Oak Leaf Clusters.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nAfter graduating New York Law School in 1950, Gilman served as assistant attorney general to the Attorney General of New York from 1953 until 1955. Following this, he practiced law privately in his hometown of Middletown, New York.\nGilman was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1967 to 1972, sitting in the 177th, 178th and 179th New York State Legislatures. He was a member of the New York State Southeastern Water Commission.\n\n\n== Tenure ==\nGilman first won election to Congress in 1972 to represent New York's 26th congressional district. New York's congressional districts had been redrawn in reapportionment, and in the general election Gilman defeated incumbent congressman John G. Dow, a Democrat who had been serving in New York's 27th congressional district, (which included most of the territory and population of the new 26th district). Gilman subsequently served in Congress from January 3, 1973, until January 3, 2003. During his time in Congress, he was chair of the House Committee on International Relations (104th through 106th Congresses).\nHe was widely regarded as a moderate Republican in the mold of New York's Nelson Rockefeller He was active on foreign affairs issues, serving as a Congressional delegate to the United Nations, serving under Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick in 1981. He was a Member of the Ukraine Famine Commission, a member of the U.S., European, Canadian and Mexican Interparliamentary conferences, and a Congressional Advisor to the U.N. Law of the Sea Conference. He was co-chair of the Committee on Irish Affairs and participated on the International Task Force on Narcotics. He was a recipient of the Secretary's Distinguished Service Award, a gold medal and certificate which represents the highest civilian honor bestowed by the State Department.\nThroughout his years in Congress, he was a member of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee, the name of which evolved into the Government Reform and Oversight Committee in the 1990s. As a co-founder of the House Select Committee on Narcotics, he served as a senior member on that Committee (1977\u20131989) and continued to serve as a member until the committee was abolished in 1993.\nDuring the 1970s, Gilman became closely identified with the issue of Prisoners of War and Missing in Action in Southeast Asia. He served on the Select Congressional Committee on that problem, and was one of only two Members of Congress to vote in opposition to closing the book on the POW/MIA situation.\nHe also became involved with World hunger in the 1970s, authoring the legislation creating a presidential Commission Against Hunger, to which he was subsequently appointed by President Jimmy Carter.\nAs the chair of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, from 1995 to 2002, Congressman Gilman consistently advocated stronger ties with India\n, as a counterweight against Chinese influence in the region, particularly in Pakistan. During the Kargil War against Pakistan, he urged American lawmakers to pressure the Pakistani government to withdraw from the conflict, stating that he held Pakistan solely responsible for the conflict. During a Hearing on the Status of Negotiations between China and Tibet in April 2000, Congressman Gilman said, \u201cThe Tibetan cause enjoys the global support that it does because it is a courageous attempt by a Nation and a people who are trying to regain what is rightfully theirs by throwing off the repression of colonization. It is in the interest of international stability to have Tibet once again serve as it had for 2000 years as a buffer zone strategically placed between India and China.\u201d In recognition of his contribution to furthering U.S. ties with India, he was awarded that country's second highest civilian honor, the Padma Vibhushan, in 2001. He is one of only 12 foreigners, and one of only 3 Americans not of Indian origin, to have received the award. In his later years in Congress, Gilman was a vociferous and frequent critic of President Bill Clinton, particularly on matters related to American foreign policy.Congressman Gilman helped gain passage of the International Academic Opportunity Act of 2000, establishing exchange programs for American students to study abroad. Named after Gilman is the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship, a program for Pell Grant eligible American college students to study or intern abroad administered by the United States Department of State.\nStudy abroad is a special experience for every student who participates. Living and learning in a vastly different environment of another nation not only exposes our students to alternate views, but also adds an enriching social and cultural experience. It also provides our students with the opportunity to return home with a deeper understanding of their place in the world, encouraging them to be a contributor, rather than a spectator in the international community.Congressman Gilman retired from Congress in 2003 after New York's 20th congressional district, which he had represented, was broken up and dispersed among the 17th, 18th, 19th and 22nd Congressional Districts in the redistricting that followed the 2000 census and reapportionment. At the time of his retirement, Gilman was the oldest sitting representative in the U.S. House (in all of Congress, only Senators Strom Thurmond and Robert Byrd were older). He was the senior Republican representing New York, and the second-most senior Member from New York overall behind only Charles B. Rangel. In 2003, following his retirement from Congress, the Dalai Lama bestowed upon Congressman Gilman the International Campaign for Tibet's Light of Truth Award.On March 28, 2008, Gilman participated in the ribbon cutting ceremony for the Gilman Center for International Education in his hometown of Middletown, New York, on the campus of SUNY Orange, also known as Orange County Community College. This modern new facility for international studies is expected to attract students from throughout the world, and houses Gilman's public papers from throughout his 36 years in elective office. Various photographs and memorabilia from throughout his career are on display.\nOn Jun 14, 2011, Gilman was awarded the Top Honor Prize, and recognized by the World Peace Prize Awarding Council for being a lifelong champion of human rights: fighting world hunger, narcotic abuse and trafficking.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGilman was married three times: to the former Jane Prizant (1927\u20132000), a lawyer and daughter of a well-known actor of the Yiddish theater (Hyman Prizant), to Rita Kelhofer, and to Georgia Tingus. His children (from the first marriage) were Jonathan Gilman, Susan Gilman-Harts, Harrison Gilman, David Gilman (deceased) and Ellen Gilman (deceased). Subsequent to his retirement, he continued to live in Middletown, his home in the Hudson Valley district that he represented.\n\n\n== Death ==\nGilman died on December 17, 2016, at the Castle Point Veteran's Hospital in Fishkill (town), New York from surgical complications, eleven days after his 94th birthday. He was survived by his third wife, Georgia, by three of his five children: sons Jonathan and Harrison, and daughter Susan.  He is also survived by a stepdaughter, Nicole Pappas, and a stepson, Peter Tingus.  He was survived by eleven grandchildren.  A daughter, Ellen, and a son, David, both predeceased him.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Jewish members of the United States Congress\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUnited States Congress. \"

"Andong| Andong| Cities in North Gyeongsang Province| ","Andong (Korean pronunciation: [an.do\u014b]) is a city in South Korea, and the capital of North Gyeongsang Province. It is the largest city in the northern part of the province with a population of 167,821 as of October 2010. The Nakdong River flows through the city. Andong is a market centre for the surrounding agricultural areas.\nSince the 1970s Andong has developed rapidly, although the population has fallen by nearly seventy thousand as people have moved away to Seoul, Busan, Daegu and other urban centres. In the late 1990s and early 2000s it became a tourism and cultural center.\nAndong is known as a centre of culture and folk traditions. The surrounding area maintains many types of traditions and the Andong Folk Festival is held in mid October every year. One of the most famous aspects of these cultural festivities are the Andong masks.\nAndong National University, specialising in education and Korean folklore, has grown rapidly since the 1970s. Other tertiary institutions include Andong Science College and Catholic Sangji College.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAround 1 BC, Andong was founded by the Jinhan people, and it was known as Gochang. During the Three Kingdoms period, the area was controlled by the Silla kingdom. The Battle of Gochang in 930 was fought here between Hubaekje forces and the Goryeo army led by Wanggeon, who won control of the city and renamed it Andong.\nAfter the ascent of the Joseon dynasty to the throne of Korea, Andong became a centre of Confucianism. The area was extremely conservative for a long time and produced many leading confucian scholars. Toe-gye Yi Hwang (1501\u201370), one of the most prominent of all Korean scholars, came from Andong. Yi Hwang retired back to his homeland late in life and started the establishment of the great Confucian academy Dosan Seowon there, which was finished after his death. During this period Andong and its principal families were influential within Korean political circles, of which the three notable families were the Andong Kim, Andong Jang and Andong Kwon clans.\nAfter the 16th century Andong became less influential until the early 19th century, when a marriage of the local Kim family resulted in strong influence on the royal family.\nAndong was the site of intense fighting during the Korean War in the early 1950s, the Battle of Andong. Although the city was almost destroyed, it was quickly rebuilt. In 1976 the Andong Dam was built, providing the city with a reliable source of electricity.\nIn 1999, Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom celebrated her 73rd birthday in the city. There is an exhibit dedicated to this historic visit at Hahoe folk village museum. Andong soju is made using traditional methods that are centuries old unlike its popular modern counterparts.  It is protected by government regulation to preserve authenticity and commands a steep premium in the marketplace.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nAndong is divided into 1 eup, 13 myeon and 10 dong. The following is a list of eup, myeon and dong:\n\n\n== Local specialty foods ==\n\nAndong has famous local foods that originated in the city such as heotjesabap, Andong jjimdak, Andong soju (a rice wine), Andong sikhye (a punch), Geonjin guksu (a noodle dish), and salted mackerel.Heotjesabap is a variety of bibimbap, served with soy sauce (ganjang) instead of the gochujang (hot pepper paste) that is more commonly used. Heotjesa bab consists mainly of several types of namul (young sprouted vegetables) over white rice. It is also served with grilled fish, shark, and jeon (Korean pancake).

He was a handy and consistent goal-kicker for the Lions, kicking at least 18 goals in all but his first and last season. Although the club had limited success in this era he did play in a Preliminary Final with the club in 1960 and in their Night Premiership side (Pre-season premiership) in 1959.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nCampbell later turned to coaching and after a stint with the reserves he got his first taste of the big time when he was briefly Fitzroy's caretaker coach following Graham Donaldson's resignation in 1974. The next year he joined West Perth and coached them to the 1975 WAFL premiership.\nHe was coach of West Perth until 1977 before returning to Fitzroy where was appointed their senior coach. It started well for Campbell as he steered the Lions to another Night Premiership but the 1978 season would be his only year in charge as the Lions finished out of the finals in ninth position.\nWhen Percy Johnson was fired as West Perth coach during the middle of the 1979 season Campbell was brought back and he stayed until the end of the 1981 season. However, he had no further success at West Perth with the club failing to make the final four in any of the years from 1979 to 1981. Ross Gibbs debuted for West Perth in 1979 and he later played under Campbell again at Glenelg.\nFrom 1983 to 1984, he was coach of Glenelg Football Club in the South Australian National Football League. Campbell's career in Adelaide got off to a bad start as Glenelg lost their first eight games of the 1983 season. He was actually sacked by the club at one point during this run, but was re-appointed the following day. After losing their first eight games, the Tigers started to return to the form which had seen them play in the previous two Grand Finals as they made a bid for the finals. Their run was halted with a 74-point loss to eventual premiers West Adelaide in Round 21 (of 22 rounds).\nCampbell continued as Glenelg coach in 1984 with the team improving to finish a strong 3rd, but he wasn't retained at the end of the year, bringing the curtain down on a 28-year career in league football. He was replaced as coach by former Glenelg champion player Graham Cornes.\n\n\n== Television career ==\nA natural speaker with the \"

He served in the National Assembly of Serbia from 2008 to 2012 as a member of the Democratic Party (Demokratska stranka, DS) and is now a member of the breakaway Social Democratic Party (Socijaldemokratska stranka, SDS).\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nBrestova\u010dki was born in Erdevik, a village in the municipality of \u0160id, in what was then the Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina in the Socialist Republic of Serbia, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He is a mechanic in private life and has served on the managing board of the agricultural enterprise Erdevik. Prior to his election to the National Assembly, he was co-ordinator of Vojvodina's capital investment fund in the Srem District.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== Democratic Party ===\nBrestova\u010dki was included in the DS's electoral lists for the National Assembly of Serbia in the 2003 Serbian parliamentary election and the 2007 Serbian parliamentary election, though he was not selected for its assembly delegation on either occasion. (From 2000 to 2011, parliamentary mandates were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates, and the mandates were often distributed out of numerical order. Brestova\u010dki's position on the list had no bearing on whether he received a mandate on either occasion.)He received the eighteenth position on the DS's For a European Serbia coalition list in the 2008 Serbian parliamentary election. The list won 102 seats, and, this time, he was selected for a mandate. This election did not produce a clear winner; after extended negotiations, the For a European Serbia alliance formed a new coalition government with the Socialist Party of Serbia. Brestova\u010dki served as a supporter of the ministry. In October 2010, he was appointed to the assembly committee on local self-government.Serbia's electoral system was reformed in 2011, such that parliamentary mandates were awarded in numerical order to candidates on successful lists. Stanimirovi\u0107 received the 140th position on the DS's Choice for a Better Life list in the 2012 parliamentary election; the list won sixty-seven mandates, and he was not re-elected.Brestova\u010dki also served in the \u0160id municipal assembly and was the leader of the For a European Serbia group in this body while also serving in the National Assembly. In September 2011, during a debate on the official status of the Croatian in the municipality, he condemned a statement by a far-right Serbian Radical Party representative that was considered as hate speech against Croats. He served as president of the municipal assembly for a time until a new local coalition government was formed in September 2012.\n\n\n=== Social Democratic Party ===\nThe Democratic Party experienced a serious split in early 2014, with Boris Tadi\u0107 setting up a breakaway group initially called the New Democratic Party. This group contested the 2014 election in a fusion with the Greens of Serbia and in alliance with other parties. Brestova\u010dki sided with Tadi\u0107 in the split and was given the sixty-fourth position on the alliance's electoral list. The list won eighteen mandates, and he was not returned. The New Democratic Party was reconstituted as the SDS later in the year, and Brestova\u010dki was elected as president of the party's Vojvodina executive committee in June 2015. He is also the president of the SDS's organization in \u0160id, and in September 2015 he became deputy mayor of the municipality when the party entered a new local coalition government.For the 2016 parliamentary election, the SDS ran in an alliance with the Liberal Democratic Party and the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina. Brestova\u010dki received the sixty-fourth position on their combined list and was again not returned when it won only thirteen seats. He also appeared in the third position on a combined SDS\u2013Liberal Democratic Party list in the concurrent 2016 Vojvodina provincial election. The list did not cross the electoral threshold to win representation in the Assembly of Vojvodina.\n\n\n== References =="

It included the Howard Street Tunnel, the Mount Royal Station for B&O's Royal Blue Line passenger trains, and the first mainline railroad electrification in the United States. The line is currently operated by CSX Transportation as part of its Baltimore Terminal Subdivision.\n\n\n== Origins ==\n\nThe B&O's original connection to New York in Baltimore was through surface street transfers to the old Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad (PW&B), with passenger / freight cars (also known then as rail carriages) pulled by horses along the east\u2013west running East Pratt Street route, first between the B&O's old Pratt Street Depot at Pratt and South Charles Streets, then later using the new terminal and B.& O.'s general headquarters of Camden Street Station (built 1857\u20131865)  to the PW&B's President Street Station (built 1849\u20131850) at President and Fleet Streets, east of the harbor past the waterfront piers from the early 1830s to early 1870s. This transfer process was also used because of ordinances passed by the Baltimore City Council in 1831 prohibiting the use of early steam locomotives within the city limits on downtown streets in the more primitive years of early American railroading.\n In 1884, the PW&B was purchased and absorbed by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), the growing dominant regional line in the Northeast states and a major rival of the B&O, and the PRR cut off the connection to the East Coast seaboard's main line. The B&O then proceeded to build its Philadelphia Branch (formally known as the Baltimore and Philadelphia Railroad) to connect to the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, in turn connecting with the Central Railroad of New Jersey for B&O's New York service across the Hudson River to Manhattan. The combination also provided a connection to the Staten Island Railway, which served as the terminal switching company for the B&O's New York freight service across the Hudson River or Upper New York Bay to Manhattan. New B&O president Charles F. Mayer made the Belt Line a priority by the 1870s, and recruited young railroader Samuel Rea to work on it as Chief Engineer.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nConnecting the new Philadelphia Branch to the rest of the B&O system was a considerable engineering challenge. A new surface line across the center of town was politically impossible and prohibitively expensive. Building around the outskirts of town would have required massive regrading and bridging, as the terrain is extremely hilly and the line would cut across every watershed flowing into the harbor. As a temporary expedient, traffic was handled through Baltimore on carfloats across the Patapsco River / Baltimore harbor and port from Canton to Locust Point, but it was clear that a direct connection would have to be built.\nThe route the B&O chose started from the existing end of track at Camden Street Station, at the west end of \"

"Demand_articulation| Emerging technologies| ","Demand articulation is a concept developed within the scientific field of innovation studies which serves to explain learning processes about needs for new and emerging technologies. Emerging technologies are technologies in their early phase of development, which have not resulted in concrete products yet. Many characteristics of these technologies, such as the technological aspects but also the needs of users concerning the technology, have not been specified yet. Demand articulation can be defined as \u2018iterative, inherently creative processes in which stakeholders try to address what they perceive as important characteristics of, and attempt to unravel preferences for an emerging innovation\u2019.The approach may be applied to describing the processes by which needs for emerging technologies become more concrete over time. At the same time, demand articulation can also be perceived as learning processes that can be evaluated.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe concept of demand articulation originates from the theoretical school that explains innovations as a result of the co-evolution of technological developments and societal pressures. The central idea behind this school is that innovations are not only deterministically formed following technological considerations and possibilities, but in interaction with societal aspects, such as ethical questions, user demands, implementation issues.In the emergent phase, several aspects of the technology remain rather \u2018fluid\u2019 and can be formed by stakeholders involved. In this period, co-evolution of society and technology takes place and \u2018societal entrenchment of a technology\u2019 is carried by different processes in which several aspects of the technology become articulated over time. In the 1990s, the term articulation processes was introduced, including articulation of technology specifications, of product and maintenance networks, of cultural and political acceptability, and of demands.Demand articulation processes owe much to the work of Teubal, in which he stated that in existing markets users have defined their needs quite precisely, and prices (also of competitors) play a major role in sales decisions. With breakthrough, radical, emerging technologies there are no markets and needs in place. Producers can only offer blueprints. However, users might not have thought of the direction of solutions the new product offers, and the regime as a whole might even change as a result of the innovation, which both can lead to different preferences of users.\nIn order to deal with the determination of user preferences in the context of emerging technologies, Teubal  introduced the term market determinateness as \u201cthe degree of specificity of the market signals received by the innovating firm and consequently to the extent to which it anticipates demand. In order to explain the concept we introduce four types of market signals, in ascending order of specificity: (1) signals about a need; (2) signals about a product class; (3) signals about basic functions; (4) signals about product specifications.\u201d Ideally, as a technology emerges and several of its aspects become clear, users are also becoming specific about their \u2018market signals\u2019 or demands.\nKodama  later picked up market determinateness or demand articulation, which he defined as \u201ca dynamic interaction of technological activities that involves integrating potential demands into a product concept and decomposing this product concept into development agendas for its individual component technologies\u201d. Building on this, the term \u2018latent demand\u2019 was introduced, which means that most stakeholders will not have an evident idea of what they want from the start. An actor might have a certain need that is ill-defined or latent, but which, in a sense, cannot be denied. For example, there have been an evident need for communication over long distances and even a then-farfetched idea of mobile communication devices, but the precise need for mobile phones (or SMS services for that matter) could not be foreseen before the introduction of these devices. The demand articulation process, therefore, is the start of a consciousness-raising exercise in which demands become increasingly concrete.\n\n\n== Definition of demand ==\nThe definition of demand merits special attention in the context of demand articulation. A clear distinction should be made between two types of demands:\nEconomic or market demand, i.e. actor X wants a product and is prepared to pay a certain price);\nSubstantive demand, i.e. actor X has ideas about how to develop a new technology.Following the distinction made by Teubal  above, substantive demand are more relevant in the emergent phase of technological development. Mowery and Rosenberg  underline this by criticising the use of \u201cthe rather shapeless and elusive notion of [market] \u2018needs\u2019\u201d.\nDemands should be regarded as a broad concept that includes a range of concepts varying in level of determinedness and varying in content areas. Concerning the varying degree of concreteness, demands include (ranging from less to more concrete):\n\nScience fictions, (guiding) visions, mission statements, \u2018Leitbilder\u2019, expectations or promises, being real-time representations of future technological situations and capabilities. They include statements on the future (\u2018we expect\u2026\u2019, \u2018we anticipate\u2026\u2019, etc.). Visions are \u201cmental images of an attainable future shared by a collection of actors; they guide the actions of and interactions between those actors\u201d.\nPerceptions of problems and obstacles with existing products or situations.\nIdeas and solutions: the actor acknowledges a problem, knows a direction for solutions, and has some concrete ideas about how this end state should be reached.\nConcrete and latent needs for existing and non-existing products: \u201cuser needs in general are the preferences of the user for the properties of the service or alternatively for the performance dimensions of the product\u201d.\nConcerns about ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) regarding new technologies.Concerning the content range, demands may include cultural, political, ethical, social issues, because in early stages of technology development it is unclear which issues would become important in steering, and because user preferences are diverse and partially dependent on these issues.\n\n\n== Demand articulation and innovation ==\nUsers of products and services have the potential to contribute to innovation processes and to the success of eventual innovations. In the 1970s the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) conducted the SAPPHO-study in which resembling successful and unsuccessful innovations were compared. \u201cThe single measure that discriminated most clearly between success and failure was \u2018user needs understood\u2019\u201d. Building on this finding, Von Hippel and his colleagues found that users were major sources or \u201cloci\u201d of innovations in several sectors. Not only do users point to directions of future needs, they could also have first-hand information on new research directions, ideas, problems, and solutions.\nThe role of demand-side actors has also been studied in a more holistic way in the innovation system literature. Here, users \u2013 and also intermediary organisations \u2013 appear as major actors that are engaged in demand articulation processes. Innovation occurs at the intersection of needs and opportunities, both of which show a large degree of variability and unpredictability. This requires not only exchange of information on qualities and costs of innovations, but also of information on the (technological and user-related) contents of these innovations. This content needs to be communicated. The major role of knowledge in user-producer interactions calls for an emphasis on interactive learning; to innovate successfully, producers constantly need to learn about the technological possibilities as well as about user needs.\nThese interactive learning processes in which demands for (characteristics of) innovations are increasingly better understood can be regarded as demand articulation.\n\n\n== Demand articulation in public innovation policy ==\nIn the light of the benefits of understanding user needs, poorly articulated demand is regarded as one of the systemic failures that innovation systems can face. Demand articulation, strategy and vision development should be stimulated. Public innovation policy can contribute to this by contemplating the use of demand-oriented policy instruments, besides supply-, diffusion- and infrastructure-oriented instruments. Examples of demand-oriented innovation policy instruments are public procurement, visioning exercises to produce R&D agendas  and facilitate user-producer interactions in local, experimental transdisciplinary settings.In several countries, including Germany  and the Netherlands, demand-oriented innovation policy gradually gained momentum.\n\n\n== References =="

The French army, which was advancing eastward on the south side of the Danube, managed to catch an isolated Austrian infantry regiment. In the ensuing combat, the Austrians were cut to pieces. Friedberg is a Bavarian town located on the Lech River near Augsburg. The action was fought during the War of the First Coalition.\nTwo French armies crossed the Rhine and thrust east into Germany in the Rhine Campaign of 1796. Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's Army of Sambre-et-Meuse advanced on a more northerly route while Moreau's Army of Rhin-et-Moselle took a more southerly path. Opposing them were Wilhelm von Wartensleben's Army of the Lower Rhine and Latour's Army of the Upper Rhine, both under the overall direction of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen. Moreau defeated Charles at the battles of Ettlingen on 9 July and Neresheim on 11 August.\nAs the outnumbered Austrians retreated, Charles looked for a chance to throw a superior force against one of the French armies. That opportunity came in late August when a cavalry brigadier Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf reported an opening. Leaving Latour's army severely weakened, the archduke rapidly marched north with 27,000 troops to join with Wartensleben in defeating Jourdan at the Battle of Amberg on 24 August. Unaware of Charles' maneuver, Moreau forged ahead and smashed the isolated Schr\u00f6der Infantry Regiment Nr. 7 at Friedberg. Unfortunately for Moreau, Jourdan's drubbing at Amberg and a second defeat at W\u00fcrzburg ruined the French offensive. By the beginning of September, the increasingly isolated Moreau was compelled to retrace his steps toward France.\n\n\n== References ==\nDodge, Theodore Ayrault (2011).

His knowledge of anatomy and medicine enabled him to write on such a subject, and, despite criticism, the book passed through a sixth edition in 1824.\nHe was for several years examining chaplain to the Bishop of Salisbury, John Fisher who in 1823 gave him the mastership of St. Nicholas's Hospital and the prebend of South Grantham in Salisbury Cathedral. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, in spite of an attempt to exclude him in consequence of his Remarks on Scepticism.\nIn 1823 he married the eldest daughter of John Delafield of Kensington; but within a few weeks he was struck down with a fever, and died at Winchester on 30 June 1824.

"Hashimoto%27s_thyroiditis| Aging-associated diseases| Autoimmune diseases| Endocrine diseases| Thyroid disease| ","Hashimoto's thyroiditis, also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and Hashimoto's disease, is an autoimmune disease in which the thyroid gland is gradually destroyed. Early on, symptoms may not be noticed. Over time, the thyroid may enlarge, forming a painless goiter. Some people eventually develop hypothyroidism with accompanying weight gain, fatigue, constipation, depression, hair loss, and general pains. After many years the thyroid typically shrinks in size. Potential complications include thyroid lymphoma. Furthermore, because it is common for untreated patients of Hashimoto\u2019s to develop hypothyroidism, further complications can include, but are not limited to, high cholesterol, heart disease, heart failure, high blood pressure, myxedema, and potential pregnancy problems.Hashimoto's thyroiditis is thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include a family history of the condition and having another autoimmune disease. Diagnosis is confirmed with blood tests for TSH, T4, and antithyroid autoantibodies. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include Graves\u2019 disease and nontoxic nodular goiter.Hashimoto's thyroiditis is typically treated with levothyroxine. If hypothyroidism is not present, some may recommend no treatment, while others may treat to try to reduce the size of the goiter. Those affected should avoid eating large amounts of iodine; however, sufficient iodine is required especially during pregnancy. Surgery is rarely required to treat the goiter.Hashimoto's thyroiditis affects about 5% of Caucasians at some point in their lives. It typically begins between the ages of 30 and 50 and is much more common in women than men. Rates of the disease appear to be increasing. It was first described by the Japanese physician Hakaru Hashimoto in 1912. In 1957, it was recognized as an autoimmune disorder.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nMany symptoms are attributed to the development of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.  The most common symptoms include: fatigue, weight gain, pale or puffy face, feeling cold, joint and muscle pain, constipation, dry and thinning hair, heavy menstrual flow or irregular periods, depression, panic disorder, a slowed heart rate, and problems getting pregnant and maintaining pregnancy.Hashimoto\u2019s disease is about seven times more common in women than in men. It can occur in teens and young women, but more commonly appears in middle age, particularly for men. People who develop Hashimoto\u2019s disease often have family members who have thyroid or other autoimmune diseases, and sometimes have other autoimmune diseases themselves.The thyroid gland may become firm, large, and lobulated in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but changes in the thyroid can also be nonpalpable. Enlargement of the thyroid is due to lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis, rather than tissue hypertrophy. While their role in the initial destruction of the follicles is unclear, antibodies against thyroid peroxidase   or thyroglobulin are relevant, as they serve as markers for detecting the disease and its severity. They are thought to be the secondary products of the T cell-mediated destruction of the gland.It is also characterized by invasion of the thyroid tissue by leukocytes, mainly T-lymphocytes. A rare but serious complication is thyroid lymphoma, generally the B-cell type, non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n\n== Risk factors ==\nThe strong genetic component is borne out in studies on monozygotic twins, with a concordance of 38\u201355%, with an even higher concordance of circulating thyroid antibodies not in relation to clinical presentation (up to 80% in monozygotic twins). Neither result was seen to a similar degree in dizygotic twins, offering strong favour for high genetic aetiology.\n\n\n=== Medications that influence thyroid function ===\nCertain medications or drugs have been associated with altering and interfering with thyroid function. Of these drugs, there are two main mechanisms of interference that they can have.\nOne of the mechanisms of interference is when a drug alters thyroid hormone serum transfer proteins. Estrogen, tamoxifen, heroin, methadone, clofibrate, 5-flurouracile, mitotane, and perphenazine all increase thyroid binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens, anabolic steroids such as danazol, glucocorticoids, and slow release nicotinic acid all decrease TBG concentrations. Furosemide, fenoflenac, mefenamic acid, salicylates, phenytoin, diazepam, sulphonylureas, free fatty acids, and heparin all interfere with thyroid hormone binding to TBG and/or transthyretin.\nThe other mechanism that medications can utilize to interfere with thyroid function would be to alter extra-thryoidal metabolism of thyroid hormone. Propylthiouracil, glucocorticoids, propanolol, iondinated contrast agents, amiodarone, and clomipramine all inhibit conversion of T4 and T3. Phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin and carbamazepine all increase hepatic metabolism. Finally, cholestryamine, colestipol, aluminium hydroxide, ferrous sulphate, and sucralfate are all drugs that decrease T4 absorption or enhance excretion.\n\n\n=== HLA genes ===\nThe first gene locus associated with autoimmune thyroid disease was major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6p21. It encodes HLAs. Specific HLA alleles have a higher affinity to autoantigenic thyroidal peptides and can contribute to autoimmune thyroid disease development. Specifically, in Hashimoto\u2019s disease, aberrant expression of HLA II on thyrocytes has been demonstrated. They can present thyroid autoantigens and initiate autoimmune thyroid disease. Susceptibility alleles are not consistent in Hashimoto\u2019s disease. In Caucasians, various alleles are reported to be associated with the disease, including DR3, DR5 and DQ7.\n\n\n=== CTLA-4 genes ===\nThis gene is the second major immune-regulatory gene related to autoimmune thyroid disease. CTLA-4 gene polymorphisms may contribute to the reduced inhibition of T-cell proliferation and increase susceptibility to autoimmune response. CTLA-4 is a major thyroid autoantibody susceptibility gene. A linkage of the CTLA-4 region to the presence of thyroid autoantibodies was demonstrated by a whole-genome linkage analysis. CTLA-4 was confirmed as the main locus for thyroid autoantibodies.\n\n\n=== Protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor-type 22 gene ===\nPTPN22 is the most recently identified immune-regulatory gene associated with autoimmune thyroid disease. It is located on chromosome 1p13 and expressed in lymphocytes. It acts as a negative regulator of T-cell activation. Mutation in this gene is a risk factor for many autoimmune diseases. Weaker T-cell signaling may lead to impaired thymic deletion of autoreactive T cells, and increased PTPN22 function may result in inhibition of regulatory T cells, which protect against autoimmunity.\n\n\n=== Immune-related genes ===\nIFN-\u03b3 promotes cell-mediated cytotoxicity against thyroid mutations causing increased production of IFN-\u03b3 were associated with the severity of hypothyroidism. Severe hypothyroidism is associated with mutations leading to lower production of IL-4 (Th2 cytokine suppressing cell-mediated autoimmunity), lower secretion of TGF-\u03b2 (inhibitor of cytokine production), and mutations of FoxP3, an essential regulatory factor for the Tregs development. Development of Hashimoto\u2019s disease was associated with mutation of the gene for TNF-\u03b1 (stimulator of the IFN-\u03b3 production), causing its higher concentration.Preventable environmental factors, including high iodine intake, selenium deficiency, and infectious diseases and certain drugs, have been implicated in the development of autoimmune thyroid disease in genetically predisposed individuals.\n\n\n=== Iodine ===\nExcessive iodine intake is a well-established environmental factor for triggering thyroid autoimmunity. A higher prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies is in the areas with higher iodine supply.\nSeveral mechanisms by which iodine may promote thyroid autoimmunity have been proposed. Iodine exposure leads to higher iodination of thyroglobulin, increasing its immunogenicity by creating new iodine-containing epitopes or exposing cryptic epitopes. It may facilitate presentation by APC, enhance the binding affinity of the T-cell receptor, and activating specific T-cells.Iodine exposure has been shown to increase the level of reactive oxygen species. They enhance the expression of the intracellular adhesion molecule-1 on the thyroid follicular cells, which could attract the immunocompetent cells into the thyroid gland.Iodine is toxic to thyrocytes since highly reactive oxygen species may bind to membrane lipids and proteins. It causes thyrocyte damage and the release of autoantigens. Iodine also promotes follicular cell apoptosis and has an influence on immune cells (augmented maturation of dendritic cells, increased number of T cells, stimulated B-cell immunoglobulin production).Data from The Danish Investigation of Iodine Intake and Thyroid Disease shows that within two cohorts (males, females) with moderate and mild iodine deficiency, the levels of both thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies are higher in females, and prevalence rates of both antibodies increase with age.\n\n\n=== Sex ===\nStudy of healthy Danish twins divided to three groups (monozygotic and dizygotic same sex, and opposite sex twin pairs) estimated that genetic contribution to thyroid peroxidase antibodies susceptibility was 61% in males and 72% in females, and contribution to thyroglobulin antibodies susceptibility was 39% in males and 75% in females.The high female predominance in thyroid autoimmunity may be associated with the X chromosome. It contains sex and immune-related genes responsible for immune tolerance.\nA higher incidence of thyroid autoimmunity was reported in patients with a higher rate of X chromosome monosomy in peripheral white blood cells.Another potential mechanism might be skewed X-chromosome inactivation, leading to the escape of X-linked self-antigens from presentation in the thymus and loss of T-cell tolerance.Having other autoimmune diseases is a risk factor for developing Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, and the opposite is also true. Autoimmune diseases most commonly associated to Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis include celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, vitiligo, and alopecia.The genes implicated vary in different ethnic groups and the incidence is increased in people with chromosomal disorders, including Turner, Down, and Klinefelter syndromes usually associated with autoantibodies against thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase. Progressive depletion of these cells as the cytotoxic immune response leads to higher degrees of primary hypothyroidism, presenting with low T3/T4 levels, and compensatory elevations of TSH.\n\n\n== Pathophysiology ==\nMultiple  mechanisms by which the pathology of Hashimoto's thyroiditis develops have been suggested.\nVarious autoantibodies may be present against thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and TSH receptors, although a small percentage of people may have none of these antibodies present. As indicated in various twin studies, a percentage of the population may also have these antibodies without developing Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Nevertheless, antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity is a substantial factor behind the apoptotic fall-out of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CD8+ T-cells) in response to cell-mediated immune response affected by helper T-lymphocytes (CD4+ T-cells) is central to thyrocyte destruction. As is characteristic of type IV hypersensitivities, recruitment of macrophages is another effect of the helper T-lymphocyte activation, with Th1 axis lymphocytes producing inflammatory cytokines within thyroid tissue to further macrophage activation and migration into the thyroid gland for direct effect.Gross morphological changes within the thyroid are seen in the general enlargement, which is far more locally nodular and irregular than more diffuse patterns (such as that of hyperthyroidism). While the capsule is intact and the gland itself is still distinct from surrounding tissue, microscopic examination can provide a more revealing indication of the level of damage.Histologically, the hypersensitivity is seen as diffuse parenchymal infiltration by lymphocytes, particularly plasma B-cells, which can often be seen as secondary lymphoid follicles (germinal centers, not to be confused with the normally present colloid-filled follicles that constitute the thyroid). Atrophy of the colloid bodies is lined by H\u00fcrthle cells, cells with intensely eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm, a metaplasia from the normal cuboidal cells that constitute the lining of the thyroid follicles. Severe thyroid atrophy presents often with denser fibrotic bands of collagen that remains within the confines of the thyroid capsule.\n\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n\nDiagnosis is usually made by detecting elevated levels of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies in the serum, but seronegative (without circulating autoantibodies) thyroiditis is also possible.Given the relatively nonspecific symptoms of initial hypothyroidism, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is often misdiagnosed as depression, cyclothymia, premenstrual syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and less frequently, as erectile dysfunction or an anxiety disorder. On gross examination, a hard goiter that is not painful to the touch often presents; other symptoms seen with hypothyroidism, such as periorbital myxedema, depend on the current state of progression of the response, especially given the usually gradual development of clinically relevant hypothyroidism. Testing for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free T3, free T4, and the antithyroglobulin antibodies (anti-Tg), antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO, or TPOAb) and antimicrosomal antibodies can help obtain an accurate diagnosis. Earlier assessment of the person may present with elevated levels of thyroglobulin owing to transient thyrotoxicosis, as inflammation within the thyroid causes damage to the integrity of thyroid follicle storage of thyroglobulin; TSH secretion from the anterior pituitary increases in response to a decrease in negative feedback inhibition secondary to decreased serum thyroid hormones. Typically, T4 is the preferred thyroid hormone test for hypothyroidism. This exposure of the body to substantial amounts of previously isolated thyroid enzymes is thought to contribute to the exacerbation of tolerance breakdown, giving rise to the more pronounced symptoms seen later in the disease. Lymphocytic infiltration of the thyrocyte-associated tissues often leads to the histologically significant finding of germinal center development within the thyroid gland.Hashimoto's when presenting as mania is known as Prasad's syndrome after Ashok Prasad, the psychiatrist who first described it.\n\n\n== Treatment ==\n\n\n=== Managing hormone levels ===\nHypothyroidism caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis is treated with thyroid hormone replacement agents such as levothyroxine, triiodothyronine, or desiccated thyroid extract. A tablet taken once a day generally keeps the thyroid hormone levels normal. In most cases, the treatment needs to be taken for the rest of the person's life. If hypothyroidism is caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis,  the TSH levels may be recommended to be kept under 3.0 mIU/l.\n\n\n== Prognosis ==\nOvert, symptomatic thyroid dysfunction is the most common complication, with about 5% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis progressing to thyroid failure every year. Transient periods of thyrotoxicosis (over-activity of the thyroid) sometimes occur, and rarely the illness may progress to full hyperthyroid Graves' disease with active orbitopathy (bulging, inflamed eyes). Rare cases of fibrous autoimmune thyroiditis present with severe shortness of breath and difficulty swallowing, resembling aggressive thyroid tumors, but such symptoms always improve with surgery or corticosteroid therapy. Although primary thyroid B-cell lymphoma affects fewer than one in 1000 persons, it is more likely to affect those with long-standing autoimmune thyroiditis, as there is a 67 to 80 fold increased risk of developing primary thyroid lymphoma in patients of Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis.\n\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nHashimoto's thyroiditis disorder is thought to be the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in North America. Within person, place, and time descriptive trends of epidemiology, it becomes more clear on how Hashimoto's thyroiditis develops in and impacts differing populations.\n\n\n=== Personal characteristic trends ===\nOverall, Hashimoto's thyroiditis affects up to 2% of the general population. About 5% of Caucasians will develop Hashimoto's at some point in their lives. In the U.S., it affects fewer African-Americans, but is linked to greater mortality in the African-American population.  It is also less frequent in  Asian populations. About 1.0 to 1.5 in 1000 people have this disease at any time. It occurs between 8 and 15 times more often in women than in men. Some research suggests a connection to the role of the placenta as an explanation for the sex difference. Though it may occur at any age, including in children, it is most often observed in women between 30 and 60 years of age. The highest prevalence from one study was found in the elderly members of the community.Those that already have an autoimmune disease are at greater risk of developing Hashimoto's as the diseases generally coexist with each other. Common diseases seen coexisting with Hashimoto's include celiac disease, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, vitiligo, and rheumatoid arthritis.\nCongenital hypothyroidism affects 1 in 3500-4000 newborns at birth and is a version of mental retardation that can be treated if caught early, but can be hard to diagnose given that symptoms are minimal at a young age. Congenital hypothyroidism is generally caused by defects of the thyroid gland, but for most cases in Europe, Asia, and Africa, the iodine intake can cause hypothyroidism in newborns.\n\n\n=== Geographic influence of dietary trends ===\nDiets consisting of low or high iodine intake determine a population's risk of developing thyroid-related disorders. It is more common in regions of high iodine dietary intake, and among people who are genetically susceptible. Geography plays a large role in which regions have access to diets with low or high iodine. Iodine levels in both water and salt should be heavily monitored in order to protect at-risk populations from developing hypothyroidism.Geographic trends of hypothyroidism vary across the world as different places have different ways of defining disease and reporting cases. Populations that are spread out or defined poorly may skew data in unexpected ways.Iodine Deficiency Disorder (IDD) is combated using an increase in iodine in a person's diet. When a dramatic change occurs in a person's diet, they become more at-risk of developing hypothyroidism and other thyroid disorders. Combatting IDD with high salt intakes should be done carefully and cautiously as risk for Hashimoto's may increase. If making modifications to one's diet, it is important to use a clinician's discretion to ensure that the dietary changes are the best option as recommendations can vary person to person.\n\n\n=== Secular trends ===\nThe secular trends of hypothyroidism reveal how the disease has changed over the course of time given changes in technology and treatment options. Even though ultrasound technology and treatment options have improved, the incidence of hypothyroidism has increased according to data focused on the US and Europe. Between 1993 and 2001, per 1000 women, the disease was found varying between 3.9 and 4.89. Between 1994 and 2001, per 1000 men, the disease increased from 0.65 to 1.01.Changes in the definition of hypothyroidism and treatment options modify the incidence and prevalence of the disease overall. Treatment using levothyroxine is individualized, and therefore allows the disease to be more manageable with time but does not work as a cure for the disease.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlso known as Hashimoto's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is named after Japanese physician Hakaru Hashimoto (1881\u22121934) of the medical school at Kyushu University, who first described the symptoms of persons with struma lymphomatosa, an intense infiltration of lymphocytes within the thyroid, in 1912 in the German journal called Archiv f\u00fcr Klinische Chirurgie. This paper was made up of 30 pages and 5 illustrations all describing the histological changes in the thyroid tissue. Furthermore, all results in his first study were collected from four women. These results explained the pathological characteristics observed in these women especially the infiltration of lymphoid and plasma cells as well as the formation of lymphoid follicles with germinal centers, fibrosis, degenerated thyroid epithelial cells and leukocytes in the lumen. He described these traits to be histologically similar to those of Mikulic's disease. Like mentioned above, once he discovered these traits in this new disease, he names the disease struma lymphomatosa. This disease emphasized the lymphoid cell infiltration and formation of the lymphoid follicles with germinal centers, neither of which had ever been previously reported.Despite Dr.Hashimoto's discovery and publication, the disease was unfortunately not recognized as distinct from Reidel's Thyroiditis which was a common disease at that time in Europe. Although many other articles were reported and published by other researchers, Hashimoto's struma lymphomatosa was only recognized as an early phase of Reidel's Thyroiditis in the early 1900s. It was not until 1931 that the disease was recognized as a disease in its own right when researchers Allen Graham et al from Cleveland reported its symptoms and presentation in the same detailed manner as Hakaru.In 1956, Drs.Rose and Witebsky were able to demonstrate how immunization of certain rodents with extracts of other rodent's thyroid resembled the disease Hakaru and other researchers were trying to describe. These doctors were also able to describe anti-thyroglobulin antibodies in blood serum samples from these same animals.\nLater on in the same year, researches from the Middlesex Hospital in London were able to perform human experiments on patients who presented with similar symptoms. They purified anti-thyroglobulin antibody from their serum and were able to conclude that these sick patients have an immunological reaction to human thyroglobulin. From this data, it was proposed that Hashimoto's struma could be an autoimmune disease of the thyroid gland.\nIn 1957, it was recognized as an autoimmune disorder and was the first organ-specific autoimmune disorder identified.Following this recognition, the same researchers from Middlesex Hospital published an article in 1962 in Lancet which ended up including a portrait of Hakaru Hashimoto. The disease was able to become so much more well known from that moment and Hashimoto's disease became to appear more frequently in textbooks.Since those discoveries, a number of autoimmune diseases have been able to be discovered with several of them having to do with thyroid-specific antibodies.\n\n\n== Pregnancy ==\nPregnant women who are positive for Hashimoto's thyroiditis may have decreased thyroid function or the gland may fail entirely. If a woman is TPOAb-positive, clinicians can inform her of the risks for herself and her infant if the disease goes untreated. \"

"Carcoar_School_of_Arts| New South Wales State Heritage Register| Carcoar, New South Wales| Town halls in New South Wales| Schools of Arts in New South Wales| Community buildings in New South Wales| ","Carcoar School of Arts is a heritage-listed former municipal chambers and library and now community centre and museum at Icely Street, Carcoar, Blayney Shire, New South Wales, Australia. It is also known as the Municipal Council Chambers. The property is owned by the School of Arts Community Hall Carcoar Inc. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe School of Arts is the most recent of the public buildings built in Carcoar which reflect its former status as the second most populous town west of the Blue Mountains. In the past the building was used as the Municipal Council Chambers before being used as a community centre for functions and meetings.The School of Arts building opened in July 1901. It was designed by a Bathurst architect, Mr. Copeman, and built by local builders Messrs. Watson and Darrington at a cost of \u00a31011. The building was designed in the Victorian classical style with a Federation period influence.In 1983, the building underwent a works program consisting of external wall sealing, provision of damp coursing, plaster work to damaged walls, external drainage extension and painting.In December 2017, the building's new trustees announced that they were seeking funding for urgent repairs.In addition to serving as a community centre, the building also houses the Carmenhurst Military Museum on the second floor.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Carcoar School of Arts is part of an Urban Conservation Area classified by the National Trust of Australia . It is a T-shaped building constructed from locally made muddy-grey bricks. It is in the Victorian Classical style of earlier buildings in Carcoar - the courthouse, railway station, hospital and C.B.C. Bank - but also displays a strong Federation period influence, particularly in its roof construction and use of multi-coloured windows. However, the dominant classical style is evidenced by its symmetry, central pediment, banded string courses and plastered bays.The front two-storey section of the building contains a supper room, kitchen, dressing rooms, toilets and upstairs meeting room. The main body of the building, a single storey hall with stage, reflects the classical style of the exterior in its plastered detailing.\n\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe larger scale of buildings, common building line and a number of street trees in front of these buildings, create a group of significant importance.Carcoar School of Arts was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\nWhilst the most recent (public) building in Carcoar, the building achieves harmony with other buildings of similar scale through detail and form. it is a significant feature of the historic buildings comprising the focal centre of the village.The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\nThe previous uses of the building as Municipal Chambers and School of Arts endorses its community importance to the residents of Carcoar. This importance continues as it is the main community facility for functions, dances and social events.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAttraction Homepage (2007). \"

Licensed under the GNU General Public License, K9Copy is free software.\n\n\n== Features ==\nK9Copy facilitates several methods for backing up a DVD and uses libdvdcss to circumvent CSS copy protection if installed.The software enables direct backup of a single layer DVD-5 provided the user's computer has a DVD recorder. Likewise, direct backup of a dual layer DVD-9 is possible with a dual layer DVD recorder.\nK9Copy is able to fit the contents of a dual layer DVD-9 onto a single layer DVD-5. The interface allows a user to explicitly retain or discard any content from the original disc such as video titles, audio tracks, subtitles and the DVD menu. All content selected for backup is compressed to a configurable target size (4400 MB by default) and stored on the user's hard drive as either an ISO image file or a DVD VIDEO TS folder. K9Copy can either transfer the backup data to blank DVD\u00b1R media itself or utilize external DVD authoring software such as K3b for this task. Furthermore, an ISO image file produced by K9Copy can be recorded to DVD by any software on any platform capable of recording ISO images to disc.\nFunctionality for backing up a DVD to a video file (such as a MPEG-4-encoded MKV-file) rather than a disc also exists in K9Copy. The interface allows the user to select the preferred encoder (either MEncoder or FFmpeg) and codec for video and audio compression as well as a target file size or bit rate for the resulting file.\nK9Copy includes basic DVD authoring capabilities.\n\n\n== Development ==\nDevelopment was resumed in 2014, under the project listing of K9copy-reloaded at Sourceforge.net, by a new developer after the initial development of K9Copy was stopped in 2011 with the author citing the fragmentation of Linux as a major issue.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDVD Decrypter, a freeware tool that allows you to decrypt and copy DVDs to your PC's hard disk\nDVD Shrink, a freeware DVD transcoder program for Microsoft Windows that uses a DVD ripper to back up DVD video.\nHandBrake, open-source DVD to MPEG-4 converter, available for BeOS, Mac OS X, Linux and Windows, released under the terms of the GNU General Public License\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

These announcements were made by the BBC continuity announcers of the time and were read over basic in-vision captions. The \u201cprogramme\u201d was broadcast on BBC2 during trade test transmissions and was not aimed at the general public or billed in the schedule. They went out three times a day 10.00a.m., 11.30a.m., and 2.30p.m. each weekday from 23 October 1967 to 1975, then once a day at 10.30a.m. from 1975 until the final broadcast on 23 December 1982.

The clock was electronically recoloured in a variety of colour schemes in order to differentiate it from the clock used for BBC2's main presentation.\n\n\n=== Transmitters and relays ===\nThe bulletin would then start with information regarding current transmitters and relays being either on reduced power or off air. This would then be followed with news of brand new transmitters and relays and when they were due to come on air. Details of trade shows or exhibitions next and anything else related to the technical development of colour television at the time. Then there would be a recap of the day's transmitter news followed by a caption showing the address of the BBC Engineering Information Department. Because the bulletin was designed for the trade, not the general public, a degree of prior knowledge was often assumed in the script - notably it was assumed people know where the transmitters mentioned despite the fact that many of them had interesting or unusual names. \n\n\n=== Trade test colour films ===\nThe bulletin would then end with a rundown of the trade test colour films being shown on that particular day. \"

Andrew Lang included it in The Blue Fairy Book (1889).\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nA poor man begged from his brother on Christmas Eve. The brother promised him, depending on the variant, ham or bacon or a lamb if he would do something. The poor brother promised; the rich one handed over the food and told him to go to Hel (in Lang's version, the Dead Men's Hall; in the Greek, the Devil's dam). Since he promised, he set out.\nIn the Norse variants, he meets an old man along the way. In some variants, the man begs from him, and he gives something; in all, the old man tells him that in Hell (or the hall), they will want to buy the food from him, but he must only sell it for the hand-mill behind the door, and come to him for directions to use it. It took a great deal of haggling, but the poor man succeeded, and the old man showed him how to use it.\nIn the Greek, he merely brought the lamb and told the devils that he would take whatever they would give him, and they gave him the mill.\nHe took it to his wife, and had it grind out everything they needed for Christmas, from lights to tablecloth to meat and ale. They ate well and on the third day, they had a great feast. His brother was astounded and when the poor man had drunk too much, or when the poor man's children innocently betrayed the secret, he showed his rich brother the hand-mill.\nHis brother finally persuaded him to sell it. In the Norse version, the poor brother didn't teach him how to handle it. He set to grind out herrings and broth, but it soon flooded his house. His brother wouldn't take it back until he paid him as much as he paid to have it. In the Greek, the brother set out to Constantinople by ship.\nIn the Norse, one day a skipper wanted to buy the hand-mill from him, and eventually persuaded him.\nIn all versions, the new owner took it to sea and set it to grind out salt. It ground out salt until it sank the boat, and then went on grinding in the sea, turning the sea salty.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\nThe tale is classified in the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index type 565, the Magic Mill.  Other tales of this type include The Water Mother and Sweet porridge.\n\n\n=== Parallels ===\nIt is a late parallel to the Old Norse poem Grottas\u00f6ngr, found in Snorri Sturluson's Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l.\n\n\n=== Variants ===\nGeorgios A. Megas collected a Greek variant The Mill in Folktales of Greece.Japanese scholar Kunio Yanagita listed some variants of The Handmill that Ground out Salt found in Japan, and even remarked that it was part of a group of tales speculated to have been imported into Japan.

He was the youngest person ever elected to the New Jersey General Assembly and went on to serve as Essex County Executive and as the Democratic nominee for Governor of New Jersey in 1985 against incumbent Thomas Kean.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nShapiro was born in 1952 in Newark, New Jersey, the son of Myron and Henrietta Shapiro, immigrants from Canada. He grew up in Orange, Millburn, and then South Orange, attending Columbia High School in Maplewood. During high school he was suspended for leading a protest against the Vietnam War but was reinstated after the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union intervened. He then attended Harvard College, where he was managing editor of The Harvard Crimson, and received his A.B. degree cum laude in economics and history in 1974.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nAfter college, Shapiro returned to Essex County and quickly launched his political career after working for New Jersey Commissioner of Transportation Alan Sagner in Brendan Byrne's administration. He decided to run for the New Jersey General Assembly in 1975. A young unknown, he ran a methodical door-to-door campaign in targeted election districts and had Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a friend from college, accompany him on election eve. He defeated the Democratic organization candidate, Rocco Neri, by a margin of 183 votes out of 8,530 cast. At 23, he was the youngest person ever elected to the Assembly. He was in the Assembly for two terms, from 1976 to 1979, serving as chairman of the Housing Committee and vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee.In 1978, he helped push through a change in the Essex County charter creating the position of county executive. Shapiro ran for the new office, defeating the well-entrenched Democratic organization led by county chairman Harry Lerner. Four years later he was reelected with 69 percent of the vote. During his tenure as county executive, he worked for administrative reform, reorganizing 69 agencies under 8 principal departments.Shapiro became active in state and national Democratic politics. He supported Ted Kennedy, uncle of his college friend Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in the 1980 Democratic presidential primaries.

The range covers an area including Alamance County, Guilford County, Randolph County, and Chatham County in North Carolina.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nThe mountains are typical of the rolling terrain of the piedmont region of North Carolina, and are somewhat similar in formation to the nearby Caraway Mountains and Uwharrie Mountains. The Cane Creek Mountains may have formed as a part of the larger coastal range that was once the Uwharries, which are thought to have formed as a part of the Alleghenian or Appalachian orogeny 300\u2013350 million years ago during the formation and rifting of Pangaea. This earlier range is thought to have had peaks more than 20,000 feet (6,100 m) high, which would rival the Himalayas, the Andes, and the Alaska Range. However, erosion has worn this old mountain range down. The highest peaks of this old range are now found in the Appalachian Mountains on the eastern coast of North America and in the Anti-Atlas Mountains of Morocco in Africa.\nThe heavily eroded hills of piedmont, including the Cane Creek Mountains, are remnants of the sizable mountain chain.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nThe Cane Creek Mountains lie in the Carolina Slate Belt, a belt that consists of heated and deformed volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The belt is best known for old abandoned gold mines. North Carolina led the nation in gold production for 50 years, between the discovery of a 17-pound (7.7 kg) gold nugget at the Reed Gold Mine in Cabarrus County, NC near Charlotte in 1799 and the discovery of gold during the California Gold Rush of 1849. Limited gold mining continues to take place, but several mining companies continue to operate, both on the slate belt and in and near the Cane Creek Mountains.  Most mineral production in the area is crushed stone for road aggregate and pyrophyllite for factories, ceramics, filler, paint and insecticide carriers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe northern edge of the mountains begins on the southern bank of Great Alamance Creek, approximately 4 miles (6.4 km) south of Interstate 40 in Graham and runs in a southwesterly direction towards Liberty in Randolph County.  The range covers much of the southwest quadrant of Alamance County.  While much of the range is a series of rolling hills that are common throughout the North Carolina Piedmont Region, there are several peaks in the Cane Creek Mountains located north of Snow Camp.  The highest point in the range and in Alamance County is Cane Creek Mountain, which is approximately 987 feet (301 m).Perhaps the most famous peak in the range is the 267 m (902 ft) Bass Mountain, the former home of an annual bluegrass music festival.  Contrary to some local belief, Bass Mountain is not the highest peak in the range, although the range is occasionally referred to as the \"

The band's area of responsibility includes Malta and Gozo. The personnel of the AFM Band make up the only specialised marching band on the island. The band currently has 43 musicians in its ranks, who, besides their duties as bandsmen, also perform their military duties as medics and security officers. \nBand members must be musically proficient in one the following instruments:\nFlutes\nOboe\nBass Clarinets\nCornet / Trumpet\nHorns\nTrombone\nBaritone\nGuitar\nString Bass\nKeyboardThe band reports directly to the AFM's 4th Regiment.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Predecessors ===\nThe AFM Band's precursor was known as the Royal Malta Artillery Band (RMA Band), which was established in 1890 and provided the basis for the AFM Band later on. The RMA Band itself traces its origins to the year 1800, when a band with fifes and drums formed part of the Malta Light Infantry Regiment. During the Second World War, the band was suspended as its members were serving on active duty missions on mainland Europe. Music was also provided by the Band of the 1st Battalion, The King's Own Malta Regiment, which maintained its own corps of drums alongside a brass and reed band.\n\n\n=== AFM Band ===\nThe RMA Band was reactivated in 1943.

Lawson, 25 April 1945 in Alton, Hampshire, England) is an English keyboardist and contemporary composer who in the 1970s was a member of UK progressive rock band Greenslade.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early years and Greenslade ===\nDuring the 1970s Lawson was a member of Greenslade, an English progressive rock band which formed in the autumn of 1972. They made their live debut at Frankfurt's Zoom Club in November 1972, with a line-up of Dave Greenslade (keyboards), Tony Reeves (bass guitar and double bass), Andrew McCulloch (drums and percussion) and Lawson (keyboards and vocals).\nThe band recorded four studio albums: \n\n1973: Greenslade\n1973: Bedside Manners Are Extra\n1974: Spyglass Guest \u2013 UK No. 34\n1975: Time and TideIn the band Lawson largely shared composition with Dave Greenslade, generally writing the lyrics for Greenslade's music, but also contributing music of his own. In contrast to Dave Greenslade's preference for Hammond organ, mellotron and piano, Lawson proved to be a pioneer of analogue synthesizers.The band announced their disbandment in early 1976, due to management problems, and Lawson then worked as a session musician before touring with Roy Harper and later Stackridge, for which band he appeared on the 1976 album Mr. Mick. In the late 1970's he played mellotron on a BBC live broadcast of David Bedford's Instructions for Angels. He was invited to join the band of Ian Gillan who had recently left Deep Purple but had to decline. He also recorded with Chris Squire and Alan White, who were taking a break from the band Yes, alongside Jimmy Page in a project titled XYZ. Lawson also played with Curved Air and in 1982, whilst recording with Bill Wyman, was invited to play with Foreigner.\n\n\n=== Later years ===\nLawson played on the soundtrack of the film The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976) and later played with John Williams and the LSO for the films Star Wars (1977), Superman (1978) and The Fury (1978).

She is known for having convinced many neighbours of the existence of  \u2018a folk called The Invisibles\u2019. 'The Invisibles' were said to be a large group of wealthy people who attended markets and fairs without being seen. She claimed a 'Mr. Ingram' lived nearby in an invisible mountain mansion, with his daughter 'Miss Ingram', who was occasionally seen dressed completely in white. 'Mr. Ingram' would come to night time assemblies at Martha's cottage to preach.\n'Mr. Ingram' was most likely Martha's father, while Martha played 'Miss Ingram'; a sceptic, knowing Martha to have burnt her foot, once stepped on 'Miss Ingram' 's foot at a gathering and recognised the subsequent cry to be Martha's voice. However, this sceptic was chased from the countryside by her followers. Nonetheless, this sparked doubt as to the truth of Martha's tales so that Martha abandoned the trick. She instead committed herself to the Methodist cause at Llanllyfni.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nRobert Jones (Rhoslan), Drych yr Amseroedd, 97 (in O. M. Edwards' ed.);\nW. R.

"Aston_Martin_Vantage_(2018)| Aston Martin vehicles| Cars introduced in 2018| Sports cars| Front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles| ","The Aston Martin Vantage is a two-seater sports car manufactured by British luxury car manufacturer Aston Martin as a successor to the previous outgoing model which had been in production for 12 years. It was unveiled on 21 November 2017. Deliveries of the new Vantage began in June 2018.\n\n\n== Specifications and performance ==\n\nThe Vantage uses the powertrain and infotainment technology from Mercedes-Benz, like the DB11. The Vantage uses Mercedes-AMG's M177 4.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine that has a power output of 510 PS (375 kW; 503 hp) and 505 lb\u22c5ft (685 N\u22c5m) of torque as is equipped with the Mercedes COMAND system. The Vantage is capable of accelerating from 0\u2013100 km/h (0\u201362 mph) in 3.6 seconds, and attaining a top speed of 314 km/h (195 mph). The Vantage uses a rear-mounted 8-speed automatic gearbox manufactured by ZF Friedrichshafen, and will be the only vehicle that pairs the Mercedes-AMG V8 with a manual transmission when the combination is made available. The engine is positioned as far back with the chassis as possible, and a 50/50 front/rear weight distribution has been achieved with the car. The Vantage is also the first Aston Martin production car to feature an electronically controlled differential with torque vectoring, and is built around the same all-new bonded-aluminium platform as the DB11, although around 70% of its components are said to be unique to the Vantage. The car has a dry weight of 1,530 kg (3,373 lb).\n\n\n== Variants ==\n\n\n=== Vantage AMR ===\nThe Vantage AMR is a track-focused variant of the Vantage. The main highlight of the model is the replacement of the ZF 8-speed automatic transmission with a dog-leg Graziano Trasmissioni 7-speed manual transmission previously used on the V12 Vantage S. The AMR also comes with a driver-selectable AMSHIFT system which controls the throttle during gear shifting. A new limited-slip differential ensures linear delivery of power. The power-band of the engine is wider and the unit is designed to deliver 625 N\u22c5m (461 lb\u22c5ft) of torque from 2,000 rpm to 5,000 rpm. The use of a manual transmission and carbon-ceramic brakes reduce the weight by 95 kg (209 lb). New adaptive dampers with the section of Sport, Sport + and Track modes improve handling. Performance figures include a 0\u201397 km/h (60 mph) acceleration time of 3.9 seconds, half a second more than the standard Vantage while the top speed remains the same as the standard model. Visual changes include 20-inch forged wheels as available on the Rapide AMR, new carbon fibre side vents and cooling vents present on the hood a sports exhaust system with quad tailpipes and racing bucket seats. Production of the AMR will be limited to 200 units worldwide. Available exterior colours for the AMR include Sabiro Blue, Pnyx Black, China Grey and White Stone. The final 59 cars will be finished in a Sterling Green exterior colour with Lime accents and will pay homage to the 1959 24 Hours of LeMans victory of Aston Martin. Once the production of the AMR ceases, the 7-speed manual transmission will become available on the standard Vantage.\n\n\n=== Vantage Roadster ===\n\nThe Vantage Roadster was revealed in February 2020 with a fabric roof. The roof claimed to be the fastest of any automotive automatic convertible system, takes 6.7 seconds to lower and 6.8 seconds to raise and can be operated at speeds of up to 50 km/h (31 mph). The Vantage Roadster has a dry weight of 1,628 kg (3,589 lb).\n\n\n=== Vantage 007 Edition ===\nThe Vantage 007 Edition was revealed in August 2020. Inspired by the Aston Martin V8 Vantage from the 1987 James Bond film The Living Daylights, the Vantage 007 Edition comes equipped with a unique mesh grille and chrome bezel, as well as Cumberland Grey exterior paint over an obsidian black leather interior. Production is limited to 100 units.\n\n\n=== V12 Speedster ===\nIn March 2020, Aston Martin introduced the V12 Speedster, a production car inspired by the 2013 CC100 concept. Aston Martin will produce 88 units at a base price of $950,000. It uses a 5.2-litre twin turbo V12 based on the one from the DBS Superleggera but with less power and torque. The engine sends its power to a ZF 8-speed gearbox.\n\n\n=== Safety Car ===\n\nVantage became the official Safety Car of Formula One, alongside the Mercedes-AMG GT R Safety Car in early 2021. The Vantage Safety Car has a British Racing Green livery with neon yellow accents, and it has been modified to fit with Safety Car standards. The car made its debut as the Safety Car at the 2021 Bahrain Grand Prix.\n\n\n=== Vantage F1 Edition ===\n\nTo celebrate Aston Martin's return to Formula One after 61 years, the British marque introduced the rare Vantage F1 Edition. The car features a fixed rear wing at the back, has 535 PS (393 kW; 528 hp) from its 4.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8, a top speed of 314 km/h (195 mph), new 21-inch wheel rims, and a 0\u2013100 km/h (0\u201362 mph) acceleration time of 3.5 seconds. The car is available in three colours: Aston Martin Racing Green, Jet Black, and Lunar White. A convertible version called the Roadster is also available.\n\n\n=== V12 Vantage ===\nIn December 2021, Aston Martin confirmed that a V12 Vantage is in development and is slated to be released in 2022. The V12 Vantage was officially unveiled in 16 March 2022, and its production is limited to just 333 units. Its 5.2-litre V12 engine has a power output of 700 PS (515 kW; 690 hp) and 555 lb\u22c5ft (752 N\u22c5m) of torque. It has a 0\u2013100 km/h (0\u201362 mph) acceleration time of 3.5 seconds, and a kerb weight of 1,795 kg (3,957 lb).\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe design of the new Vantage is inspired by the track-only Vulcan and the purpose made DB10 that appeared in the James Bond film Spectre. The front grille, specifically inspired by the Vulcan, helps in efficient engine cooling.The Vantage's interior configuration also differs from the DB11 in various ways apart from seating capacity, such as the centre console design. Whereas the DB11's centre stack controls are quite intuitive and more spatial in terms of button/switch arrangement, the Vantage's appears more cluttered and lacks an optical disc drive, as well as separate temperature displays for the automatic climate control. For purpose of weight saving, the Vantage also forfeits the passenger glove compartment and maintains a simple centre console design (as opposed to the DB11's deluxe power-sliding variant).\n\n\n== Motorsport ==\n\n\n=== GTE ===\n\nThe Vantage GTE is the GTE-class racing version of the Vantage made to compete in the FIA world endurance championship. Like the road-going car, the GTE uses the Mercedes-AMG V8 engine, though it is paired with a 6-speed Xtrac sequential gearbox. Additional changes are made to the engine to increase power. The car is convertible to GT3 specification.\n\n\n=== DTM ===\n\nHWA AG, in partnership with Aston Martin and R-Motorsport, made an all-new car for the 2019 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters, based on the new Vantage. The Vantage competed in place of Mercedes-Benz's entry after the manufacturer left the competition to focus on Formula E.\n\n\n=== GT3 ===\n\nThe Vantage GT3 is the successor of the V12 Vantage GT3. The engine has a power output of 542 PS (399 kW; 535 hp) and 516 lb\u22c5ft (700 N\u22c5m) of torque. It features a quick-shifting Xtrac 6-speed sequential gearbox, an Alcon motorsport multi-plate clutch, \u00d6hlins four-way adjustable dampers, Alcon brakes, and a Bosch anti-lock braking system. The Vantage GT3 has a dry weight of 1,245 kg (2,745 lb).\n\n\n=== GT4 ===\n\nThe Vantage GT4 is the replacement of the previous generation GT4, and is intended for entry-level drivers in competitive motorsports. The Vantage GT4 made its debut in the 2019 24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links =="

Halfdan and his brother Gudr\u00f8d Ljome were responsible for murdering Rognvald Eysteinsson and 60 of his men by burning them inside a structure in an attempt to claim his lands. Upon learning of this event, Harald flew into a rage and sent out a great force against Gudr\u00f8d who was put under Harald's personal observance.

"Medicinal_jar| History of pharmacy| Pottery shapes| ","A medicinal jar, drug jar, or apothecary jar is a jar used to contain medicines. Ceramic medicinal jars originated in the Islamic world and were brought to Europe where the production of jars flourished from the Middle Ages onward. Potteries were established throughout Europe and many were commissioned to produce jars for pharmacies and monasteries. They are an important category of the Dutch and English porcelain known as Delftware.The jars were used by apothecaries in pharmacies and dispensaries in hospitals and monasteries. Apothecaries needed containers to store herbs, roots, syrups, pills, ointments, spices and other ingredients used to make remedies as well as the medicines themselves.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nEarthenware storage jars for drugs have been found on archaeological sites in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Greece and Rome. The technology appears to have originated in Mesopotamia in 600\u2013400 B.C. A number of innovations occurred in Western Asia regarding pottery decoration, particularly the development of tin glazes to enable jars to contain fluids. The tin glaze was believed to have originated in Mesopotamia in 600\u2013400 B.C. By the 12th to 13th centuries jars were lustreware which gave a sheen to the surface of the jars.Jars from Syria and Persia were taken to Spain from the 13th to 14th centuries after which Spanish and Italian potters began to manufacture jars. The tin glaze technique which allowed decoration of the jars was known in Europe as maiolica, faience or delftware. These different terms referred not to technical differences in the jars' manufacture but stylistic differences.The style of jar known as albarello also came from the Middle Eastern Islamic potters. The albarello is cylindrical in shape usually with a narrow waist; it has a flange at the open end. A parchment cover could be tied over the flange to seal the contents. Other jars were ovoid or globular in shape. Syrup jars had spouts and handles. Other items used by apothecaries were dispensing and ointment pots, pill tiles and mortars.Potteries producing jars were located in Spain, France, Italy, Sicily, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Holland, Sweden, and Britain.Jars were widely used in Europe and Latin America at the beginning of the 19th century but during the 18th and 19th centuries production of glass storage bottles was increased.\n\nAnimal, mineral and vegetable ingredients were stored in the jars.Vegetable ingredients included culinary herbs, fruits, roots, leaves, seeds, flowers, wood, oils, gums and resins. Spices used for medicinal purposes included cassia bark, tamarind, nux vomica, senna, sandalwood, cloves and nutmeg. These came from the Near East and later ingredients from the New World included copaiva balsam, sarsaparilla, tobacco, cinchona bark (quinine) and ipecacuanha.Some common animal products were contained, such as honey, butter, beeswax and chicken fat as well as more unusual ingredients including foxes' lungs, earthworms, scorpions, musk, ambergris and ivory. Minerals used included precious stones and sulphur, mercury, antimony and other minerals.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nMedicinal jars are collected in the Wellcome Museum, Royal College of Surgeons and Royal Pharmaceutical Society in London, the Thackray Museum of Medicine in Leeds, Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia, the Esteve Pharmacy in Ll\u00edvia, Spain, the Pharmacy Museum at the University of Basel in Switzerland and the Pharmacy Museum, Jagiellonian University Medical College in Krak\u00f3w, Poland.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nMedicinal jars\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nTheriac\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nMedical history and special collections: apothecary jars.

"Rodrigues_owl| IUCN Red List extinct species| Otus (bird)| Extinct birds of Indian Ocean islands| Bird extinctions since 1500| Fauna of Rodrigues| Birds described in 1873| Mascarenotus| ","The Rodrigues owl (Otus murivorus), also known as Rodrigues scops owl, Rodrigues lizard owl, Leguat's owl, or (somewhat misleadingly) Rodrigues little owl, was a small owl. It lived on the Mascarene island of Rodrigues, but it is nowadays extinct. It is part of the three Mascarene owls, formerly classified in the genus Mascarenotus, although they are now classified in the genus Otus. Like many of the Mascarene land-birds, the genus was a distinct relative to South-East Asian taxa, in this case apparently being a descendant of the direct ancestor of the Oriental scops owl. This insular scops owl had evolved gigantism, becoming twice as large and four times heavier than its continental ancestor.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\nIt is sometimes assumed that Leguat mentioned this bird in his 1708 memoir, but this seems to be in error; Julien Tafforet gave a good description in 1726, however. The Rodrigues bird, which Tafforet compared to the petit-duc, the Eurasian scops owl (and not, as often assumed to the little owl, the chouette chev\u00eache), was more arboreal than its congeners and fed on small birds and \"

Before he assumed leadership of the entire cartel, he allegedly served as the logistical coordinator for its Zambada-Garc\u00eda faction, which has overseen the trafficking of cocaine and heroin into Chicago and other US cities by aircraft, narcosubs, container ships, go-fast boats, fishing vessels, buses, rail cars, tractor trailers, and automobiles.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe former farmer turned drug lord began his criminal career by smuggling as little as a few kilograms of drugs at a time; however, it was only to gain a foothold before he went about increasing his gang's production of heroin and marijuana while also solidifying his position as a trafficker. When Miguel \u00c1ngel F\u00e9lix Gallardo was arrested in 1989, his organization split into two opposing factions: the Tijuana Cartel whose leadership was inherited by his nephews and heirs, the Arellano F\u00e9lix brothers; and the Sinaloa Cartel whose leadership fell to former lieutenants H\u00e9ctor Luis Palma Salazar, Adri\u00e1n G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez, Ismael Zambada Garc\u00eda, Ignacio Coronel Villarreal, and Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera (El Chapo). The Sinaloa Cartel drug lords were active in the states of Sinaloa, Durango, Chihuahua, Sonora, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and Nayarit.In 2006, the administration of President Felipe Calder\u00f3n launched an offensive against Mexico's drug trafficking networks. The Arellano Felix Organization (Tijuana Cartel), the largest and most sophisticated of the Mexican cartels at the time, received the brunt of the blows. Taking advantage of the pressure being placed on the Tijuana Cartel, other drug bosses, most notably Ismael Zambada and Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n, began to encroach on strongholds in northwestern Mexico, leading to full-scale war.\nZambada has historically worked closely with the Ju\u00e1rez Cartel and the Carrillo Fuentes family, while maintaining independent ties to Colombian cocaine suppliers. Zambada has been wanted by Mexico's attorney general's office since 1998, when it issued bounties totaling $2.8 million USD on him and five other leaders of the Ju\u00e1rez Cartel.

"Hugh_Brock| 1914 births| 1985 deaths| British pacifists| British conscientious objectors| British anti-war activists| ","Hugh Brock (1914\u20131985) was a lifelong British pacifist, editor of Peace News between 1955 and 1964, a promoter of nonviolent direct action and a founder of the Direct Action Committee, a forerunner of the Committee of 100.\n\n\n== Peace News ==\nHugh Brock was born on 15 May 1914 and trained as a printer at the London School of Printing. He was a conscientious objector in World War II. In May 1940, in the face of new defence regulations and demands in parliament for the banning of Peace News, its printer refused to continue printing it and, at the same time, the Wholesale Newsagent Association, which handled two-thirds of the circulation, refused to distribute it any longer. Working with the editor, Humphrey Moore,  Brock and his brother, Ashley, (A H Brock) took on responsibility for its printing, ignoring any potential threat under the regulations and, with peace groups across Britain, created an efficient voluntary distribution chain. Brock served a six-month prison sentence in 1941, during which time his wife Eileen gave birth to their son Jeremy. They also had a daughter, Carolyn, who was born in 1944.Brock took on the role of assistant editor of Peace News in 1946 and became editor in 1955. He shifted the focus of Peace News towards campaigning for nuclear disarmament, nonviolent direct action and the movement for colonial freedom. In 1955 he appointed the American academic Gene Sharp to Peace News to cover the Civil Rights Movement. At that time the newspaper was the official organ of the Peace Pledge Union (PPU) but this formal link was broken in 1961. He left Peace News in 1964.\n\n\n== Non-violent protest in Britain ==\nBetween 1946 and 1952 Peace News published more than 160 articles dedicated to the discussion of Gandhi's relevance to the West. During the 1950s Hugh Brock played a significant role in the growth of nonviolent protest in Britain. In November 1949 the PPU had set up a Nonviolence Commission to study nonviolent resistance and the ideas of Gandhi. In December 1951 some members formed 'Operation Gandhi' to organise nonviolent direct action directly inspired by Gandhi. Among their aims were the withdrawal of US troops from Britain and an end to Britain's production of atomic weapons. Brock was secretary of this group. Its activities began with a sit-down outside the War Office on 11 January 1952. Eleven protesters squatted in front of the War Office, having first notified the police. The protesters did not resist arrest and pleaded guilty to the charges against them, following principles of nonviolence.There were other protests at Aldermaston, Mildenhall, Porton Down and the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. The protest march to Aldermaston in 1952 involved just 35 people and paved the way for the much larger Aldermaston Marches that began in 1958.In 1957 Hugh Brock was one of a committee that arranged protests against British testing of the H-bomb on Christmas Island in the Pacific. The committee later became the Direct Action Committee, which organised the 1958 Aldermaston March. With the formation in 1960 of the Committee of 100, which organised civil disobedience against nuclear weapons on a larger scale, the Direct Action Committee merged into the new organisation.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nAfter leaving Peace News Brock continued to be involved with peace campaigning until his death in 1985. He kept a large number of papers, which were donated to the University of Bradford by his wife Eileen.The Hugh Brock Memorial Library in Kitwe in Zambia was established in his memory.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of peace activists\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArchive of Brock's papers at the University of Bradford"

The launch of the newscast was a result of the formation as Solar Television Network's news and current affairs division, which in turn was brought by the privatization of Radio Philippines Network (RPN) by Solar Entertainment. It was carried over upon the channel's rebranding as Solar News Channel in October 30.\nSolar Nightly News was simulcasted on RPN (by then affiliated by Solar Entertainment-operated ETC) from January 14 until November 29, 2013 after the network ceased production of its late-night newscast RPN NewsCap due to the retrenchment of the program's production team and other employees of the privatized network. The simulcast was also a replacement of Solar Network News to RPN's news content, as a result of Solar Entertainment's decision to scrap the cable-only limitation of American Idol season 12 and allow the broadcast to be available to RPN (over-the-air) viewers (in which the original plan was to limit the AI via satellite broadcast to cable viewers while RPN will continue to air Network News at 6 PM). On December 1, 2013, Solar News Channel switched its affiliation to RPN, making it a program at its own right.\nNancy Irlanda retired as the newscast's anchor on January 10, 2014; Mitzi Borromeo, anchor of Solar News program News Caf\u00e9 took over by the end of the month.

It may also have something to do with the fact that the Abbey of Murbach used the lake as a reservoir for trout (which can still be seen in the lake).\nIn Welche (a regional dialect) the lake is called re\u00eff tou blan.\n\n\n== References =="

Some speculate that the attacks were mounted to test the will of the new U.S. President Richard Nixon who retaliated by secretly bombing PAVN/VC sanctuaries in Cambodia the following month.\nNumerous bases were attacked, these attacks were all beaten back but did inflict casualties and reinforced the fact that PAVN/VC forces were able to mount attacks at will.\n\n\n== Long Binh/Bien Hoa ==\nIntelligence had indicators of the pending attacks. On 19 February, a defector surrendered to Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces and revealed a large VC force would attack key installations in the Saigon area to include Long Binh Post. Unfortunately, the reporting was delayed and did not reach Long Binh until the morning of 22 February 1969, the day the defector warned the attacks were set to begin.\n\nAfter sundown on the 22nd, elements of the VC 274th Regiment, 5th Division made their final preparations while occupying three hills along Highway 15 approximately three kilometers south of the base. That evening, several ambush squads from the 720th Military Police Battalion, 18th MP Brigade kept watch along potential avenues of approach to Long Binh Post. One of the MP ambush squads held a position within a kilometer of the VC stronghold. At 02:00 on 23 February, the 274th VC Regiment initiated their attack with an estimated 78 rounds of rocket and mortar fire from their positions. The rounds landed on post with some igniting the POL fuel site east of the highway.The VC made several attempts to advance on the base, but were halted. Full-scale sweeping operations to secure the perimeter began just after noon that day. M113 armored personnel carriers and M551 Sheridan armored reconnaissance vehicles supported the forces on the ground while AH-1 Cobra gunships and OH-6 helicopters provided air support. These units made occasional contact, often with PAVN or VC who fought stubbornly from trenches and spider holes.In the early morning hours of 26 February, a force of approximately 400 men from the VC 275th Regiment, 5th Division, had infiltrated into the tiny village of Thai Hiep on the outskirts of Bien Hoa. About 85 per cent of the force was estimated to be PAVN soldiers. At about 03:00, as reconnaissance elements of the unit were observed and engaged by US Air Force security forces at the perimeter of Bien Hoa Air Base, the villagers began to flee their homes, running down streets and creek beds. The villagers met elements of the South Vietnamese 5th Marine Battalion, the 3rd Battalion, 48th Infantry Regiment, 18th Division and the 3rd Squadron, 5th Armored Cavalry moving on the road less than a half mile from Thai Hiep in response to the contact at the air base. The villagers told the ARVN forces how they were driven out of their homes and confined to an area near a creek running alongside the village. At that time, the air base security forces reported that they had lost contact with the enemy reconnaissance element which withdrew east toward Thai Hiep. The ARVN units swiftly moved into blocking positions, and by daybreak, the PAVN/VC were surrounded. Additional South Vietnamese Regional Force elements moved in and the ARVN troops continued to contain the PAVN/VC forces until 11:00 when assault forces, in the form of the ARVN 36th Ranger Battalion, reinforced the contact. By 15:00 the 36th Ranger Battalion moved into the village attacking the PAVN/VC force. The series of assaults met heavy resistance by the battalion of PAVN who had turned the villagers sandbagged shelters into a series of well-fortified defensive positions. ARVN psychological operations units broadcast repeated loud-speaker appeals and warnings, and all of the remaining villagers and several wounded PAVN/VC evacuated out of Thai Riep. Just after 16:00 US Air Force F-100s and F-4s along with Republic of Vietnam Air Force A-1 Skyraiders were directed against the PAVN/VC positions in the village. Following the employment of the supporting fires, the 36th Ranger Battalion moved back into the village. The Rangers met only slight, disorganized resistance. By 01:00 the next morning, the bodies of 264 PAVN/VC soldiers lay in the village, and 87 had been captured or surrendered. More than 100 individual and crew-served weapons were captured. ARVN casualties were 10 killed and 100 wounded and one US Army photographer was killed. The prisoners revealed that their mission had been to attack Bien Hoa city and the Bien Hoa Air Base.\n\n\n== Da Nang ==\n\nSince early February 1969, the 1st Marine Division had noted an upsurge in PAVN/VC activity around Da Nang. On 7 February Company D, 1st Battalion, 26th Marines found a PAVN/VC base area near the Nam O bridge northwest of the Red Beach Base Area, leaving the base untouched, they returned at night setting up a series of ambushes that killed 18 PAVN and captured 2. On 8 February patrols from 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines found 7 122mm rockets 14km southwest of Da Nang and another 13 140mm rockets 2km further south. On 18 February a Company F, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines called in artillery fire on a group of PAVN/VC 5km south of Marble Mountain resulting in 21 secondary explosions believed to be from detonating rockets. Also in mid-February Company D, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines engaged an entrenched PAVN platoon 22km southwest of Da Nang killing 30 and the ARVN 2nd Battalion, 51st Regiment operating 4km west of the Marines killed 49 PAVN moving north of Go Noi Island.:\u200a97\u200aAfter midnight on 23 February Company K, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines and Company D, 1st Military Police Battalion detected VC approaching the Song Cau Do river bridges and attacked them killing 47 and capturing 11.

Two of the pockets were destroyed by the next morning resulting in the capture of the acting commander of the 141st Regiment. The last pocket along the An Tan ridgeline proved more difficult and Company L, 3/7 Marines suffered numerous casualties forcing it to withdraw. On the morning of 26 February following Napalm and Snake Eye air strikes, Company L, reinforced by Company M assaulted the PAVN position making slow progress against determined PAVN resistance. The attack continued into 27 February when the Marines overran the PAVN resulting in a total of more than 200 killed.:\u200a99\u2013100\u200aPAVN/VC retreating to the south from Da Nang were intercepted by elements of the 1st Marine Regiment and ARVN 1st Battalion, 51st Regiment 11km south of Da Nang losing 139 dead in 3 days of fighting.:\u200a99\u200aThe PAVN/VC attacks on Da Nang were a failure resulting in more than 500 dead.:\u200a101\u200a\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the United States Marine Corps.\n\n\n== External links ==\nCold War International History Project's Cold War Files"

On that day, near S\u00f4ng B\u00e9 in the South Vietnam, during Operation Toan Thang III Skidgel's unit was guarding a convoy when it came under enemy attack. In an attempt to draw the enemy fire away from the convoy's command group, Skidgel manned a machine gun in his vehicle while his driver steered through intense fire toward the command element. Skidgel, mortally wounded during the effort, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.\nSkidgel, aged 20 at his death, was buried in Sawyer Cemetery, Plymouth, Maine.\n\n\n== Medal of Honor citation ==\nSergeant Skidgel's official Medal of Honor citation reads:\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. Sgt. Skidgel distinguished himself while serving as a reconnaissance section leader in Troop D. On a road near Song Be in Binh Long Province, Sgt. Skidgel and his section with other elements of his troop were acting as a convoy security and screening force when contact occurred with an estimated enemy battalion concealed in tall grass and in bunkers bordering the road. Sgt. Skidgel maneuvered off the road and began placing effective machinegun fire on the enemy automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenade positions. After silencing at least 1 position, he ran with his machinegun across 60 meters of bullet-swept ground to another location from which he continued to rake the enemy positions. Running low on ammunition, he returned to his vehicle over the same terrain. Moments later he was alerted that the command element was receiving intense automatic weapons, rocket-propelled grenade and mortar fire. Although he knew the road was saturated with enemy fire, Sgt. Skidgel calmly mounted his vehicle and with his driver advanced toward the command group in an effort to draw the enemy fire onto himself. Despite the hostile fire concentrated on him, he succeeded in silencing several enemy positions with his machinegun. Moments later Sgt. Skidgel was knocked down onto the rear fender by the explosion of an enemy rocket-propelled grenade. Ignoring his extremely painful wounds, he staggered back to his feet and placed effective fire on several other enemy positions until he was mortally wounded by hostile small arms fire. His selfless actions enabled the command group to withdraw to a better position without casualties and inspired the rest of his fellow soldiers to gain fire superiority and defeat the enemy. Sgt. Skidgel's gallantry at the cost of his life were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.\n\n\n== Donald Sidney Skidgel Memorial Bridge ==\nIn 2011, the bridge on Route 2 spanning the Sebasticook River in Newport, Maine was replaced and the bridge was dedicated to Skidgel's memory bearing the name \"

Irritated by what he thinks is his colleague Kyle, he turns around to find the ghost of Dapper Jack firing green flames at him and runs away screaming about the ghost. A bustling western-style tourist town is shown, with a menacing figure walking up main street. Some tourists think they're about to see a show, but everyone runs screaming when Dapper Jack starts shooting green flames at them; then the opening credits roll.\nThe gang is in the Mystery Machine on their way to Shaggy's cousin's ranch, where she's invited him and his friends to get to know him better. Velma freaks out looking at the dude ranch's website because it uses El Cabong font, which is a terrible font choice in her opinion. Daphne calms her down and takes over looking at the website, and Fred announces that they're approaching Sorghum City. The gang appears lost, and Daphne suggests asking directions. Shaggy volunteers to go ask, but everyone he approaches runs away screaming. Daphne successfully gets directions before the man she's talking to spots Shaggy and runs off screaming. \nThe gang make their way to the ranch and Shaggy and Scooby refuse to get out of the van because everyone runs screaming when they see Shaggy. Fred, Daphne & Velma make their way to the ranch where Velma's horse allergy flares up and they meet Midge & Andy, and their children Desdemona and Buddy G, who is a famous internet video star that Daphne is a huge fan of. Buddy G is afraid of horses, but his mum thinks that he really loves them. Midge introduces them to Dave & David, and Carol & Sharon who are continuously pranking each other. A wild-looking horse rears and canters away, and the cowboys Larry & Kyle tell everyone not to worry about Buckstitch, who is the meanest horse in the west. Kyle takes a shine to Velma, and Larry takes a shine to Daphne, which Fred objects to. The cowboys announce that it's time for lunch and Shaggy and Scooby burst out of the van, causing everyone to scream that he's a ghost. Rafe bursts out of the house with a gun ready to protect everyone from the ghost, but the gang says he's not a ghost and manages to convince everyone. \nRafe takes Shaggy and everyone else inside where his cousin and Rafe examine him, before she apologizes and introduces herself as Tawny Rogers. Rafe then tells the tale of Dapper Jack, the outlaw and villain of Sorghum City. He terrorized Sorghum City as a cattle thief, bank robber and general all-around bad guy, even returning his library books late. Consequently, he's quite the tourist attraction! Sheriff Rufus Carmichael was the one who took him down and made him famous, and that's why the tourists come to Sorghum City.

The island was about 650 feet long and 400 feet wide at its widest point.\n\n\n== Island distraction ==\nWith the opening of Capri Pass in 1967, the island began experiencing rapid erosion, shrinking to 10% of its size by 1990. By 2005 Coconut Island existed as no more than a sandbar. \n Coconut \nIsland used to block the entrance into the Marco River and boaters had to divert around Coconut to get out into the Gulf. The island was thick with trees, had beaches all around the perimeter and was home to nesting Bald Eagles and several species of seabirds. Coconut became a weekend haven for Marco islanders and Naples boaters and offered magnificent shelling, great fishing and ample camping and picnic areas. Between Coconut and Hideaway Beach was a tremendous anchorage for locals and cruising boaters.\nAs erosion had its way, the island started to recede slowly. But nature was not the only culprit in the death of this barrier island. In the late 1990s, the Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve removed all the trees on Coconut, claiming the non-native trees were suffocating the natural foliage. With no trees to protect the sand from wind and water erosion, the island started to disappear rapidly. Each week there was less and less beachfront. The final blow came in 2005 when dredging equipment, used for the beach re-nourishment project on the mainland, altered the flow and natural currents. Coconut Island was gone in a few weeks.\n\n\n== Island reemergence ==\nBut, with the ever-changing coastline, a new island had emerged six years later in 2011. Rookery Bay has roped off an area of this island for nesting seabirds, leaving the perimeter beaches for picnics, shelling and fishing. Once again, there is a protected anchorage for traveling boats and a weekend destination for all to enjoy.\n\n\n== References =="

"St_Lawrence_for_Pegwell_Bay_railway_station| Disused railway stations in Kent| Former South Eastern Railway (UK) stations| Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1864| Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1916| Ramsgate| ","St Lawrence for Pegwell Bay railway station was a railway station at Ramsgate, Kent, United Kingdom that was opened by the South Eastern Railway in 1864 and closed in 1916.\n\n\n== History ==\nRamsgate was first reached by the South Eastern Railway (SER) on 13 April 1846 when it opened the extension of its line from Ashford and Canterbury to Ramsgate Town, continuing to Margate Sands on 1 December. In July 1863, the company had opened a 31 chains (620 m) spur (known as the St. Lawrence spur) to allow through running to Margate by avoiding the need to reverse at Ramsgate Town, a cramped and inconvenient station from which the line branched off to Margate at the very platform ends. In the event, the spur was little used by regular services. The building of the spur may be seen as a reaction to the arrival of a new competitor in the area, in the shape of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR); the SER now felt the need to improve their services in the area, whereas for years operating as a monopoly they had not. Another major improvement completed in 1863 was the double-tracking of its route to Margate via Westwood.Principally to cater for the very occasional train avoiding Ramsgate, a station was opened to the west of the spur by the Newington Road Bridge (now the B2014). The station opened in October 1864 and was named St Lawrence (Pegwell Bay) after nearby St Lawrence village which was swallowed up in the suburbs of Ramsgate in the early 20th century. The station was also shown as St Lawrence for Pegwell Bay in some timetables, and on the station nameboards, highlighting the proximity of Pegwell Bay. The two facing platforms were to the west of the bridge, while the station building was to the east. Offices were constructed in the two arches either side of the tracks.\n\nFrom 1 January 1899, the station was operated by the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR), which was formed out of the working union between the SER and the LCDR. The station was closed on 3 April 1916, the same day on which the SECR closed its stations at Battersea Park Road, Camberwell and Walworth Road and its platforms at Clapham High Street and Wandsworth Road, all never to reopen. St Lawrence, closed ostensibly as a war-time measure, never reopened probably because plans to rationalise the lines in Thanet had been in place since the turn of the century. The intervention of the First World War meant that it was left to the Southern Railway to realise the plans. On 2 July 1926, a new 1.375 mi (2.213 km) line was brought into use which diverged from the LCDR line on a 20 chains (400 m) curve from a point about 1 mile (1.6 km) to the south of Broadstairs station to join the SER line about 0.5 mi (0.80 km) to the west of Ramsgate near St Lawrence. The LCDR's line between Broadstairs and Ramsgate Harbour via Ramsgate Tunnel was closed, as was the SER's line from Ramsgate Town to Margate Sands.The remains of St Lawrence station were demolished as part of the works. The works also involved the rebuilding of Newington Road Bridge, originally built in 1846. To the east of the station building stood a signal box for St.Lawrence Junction, the southern junction of the St.Lawrence spur. The northern junction (called Whitehall Junction) also had a signal box, just south of Whitehall Road.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHilton, John (1981).

A one-woman show, it has been performed by a number of female singers/actors, most notably Marti Webb and Bernadette Peters. A one-act song cycle, it tells the story of an ordinary English girl from Muswell Hill, who journeys to the United States in search of love. Her romantic misadventures begin in New York City, lead her to Hollywood, and eventually take her back to Manhattan.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe musical is based on an idea originally conceived by Tim Rice, who intended to develop it as a cycle of television shows with songwriting partner Andrew Lloyd Webber. The two relished working on a small-scale project following Evita. Shortly after they began working, however, Lloyd Webber realized Rice was writing specifically for Elaine Paige, with whom the married father of two young children was having a blatant affair. Lloyd Webber felt that allowing Paige to appear in the series would suggest he approved of the relationship, so he decided to look for a new lyricist.

It was intended as a portage road to connect the St. Lawrence River valley with Lake Champlain, cutting time from the trip between Montreal and New York. Construction began in January, 1835 when surveyors determined the line would run from St. John on the Richelieu River to the nearest point on the St. Lawrence at La Prairie, across the river from Montreal.\nThroughout 1835 the grading, fencing, masonry and bridge work were completed, as well as stations and wharves at Laprairie and St. John.  Orders were also placed for a locomotive, which was to be built in Newcastle upon Tyne, as well as four passenger cars, which were to be built in the United States.  Several freight cars were also built in Montreal.\nThe 16-mile (26 km) line was built as a 4 ft 8+1\u20442 in (1,435 mm) standard gauge railway, with rails consisting of 6-inch (152 mm) pine logs (squared off) which were joined by iron splice plates and bolts laid across wood cross-ties. The pine rails were protected by iron straps spiked to the upper surface. These rails remained the same until being replaced by completely iron rails in the 1850s.\nBritish North America's first locomotive arrived at Molson's wharf in Montreal in June 1836. It was named Dorchester and had been constructed by Robert Stephenson, son of George Stephenson who was the manufacturer of The Rocket.  A wood-burning 0-4-0 design, it was the 127th locomotive built by Stephenson and was nicknamed \"
"Saugus_Middle-High_School| Public high schools in Massachusetts| Buildings and structures in Saugus, Massachusetts| Northeastern Conference| Schools in Essex County, Massachusetts| ","Saugus Middle-High School is an American public secondary school located in Saugus, Massachusetts, United States. It is a part of Saugus Public Schools.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n\n=== High school ===\nPrior to the construction of a dedicated High School building, Saugus High classes were held in the Town Hall (now an American Legion hall) and the top floor of the Roby School.From 1906 to 1955, Saugus High School was located on the corner of Central and Winter Streets. The building was expanded several times to accommodate the growing student population. The next Saugus High campus opened in September 1955. The single-story structure included a cafeteria, auditorium, offices, classrooms, and a gymnasium. The 1906 High School housed as a junior high school and elementary school until a 1963 arson. Only the 1935 addition survived, which remained an elementary school until 2003. In the summer of 2020, the 1955 Saugus High School was demolished to make way for a new sports complex.\nThe current Saugus Middle-High campus opened in 2020. Construction began on the northern portion of the school's property for a new complex in late 2018. The complex is occupied by both Saugus High School and Saugus Middle School and can hold up to 1,360 students. The Saugus Middle-High School was completed almost two years later in early 2020 with high school students officially moving into the new complex in April 2020.\n\n\n=== Middle school ===\nMiddle school classes were held in various school buildings until the construction of the Sweester School in 1926. After the Sweester School opened, middle school classes were held at Sweester and at the high school. When the new Saugus High School building opened in 1955, all middle school classes were moved to the old high school building, with the Sweester School becoming an elementary school. In October 1963, most of the Saugus Junior High School was destroyed by arson.  Junior High classes were moved to the Veterans' Memorial Elementary School and the American Legion Hall, with seventh and eighth graders attending during the day and ninth graders attending class in the afternoon. In 1966, the new Saugus Junior High School on Dow St. opened. In 1970 the school was renamed the Belmonte Middle School after Augustine J. Belmonte, a Saugus police officer killed in the line of duty. The Belmonte closed when the new complex opened in 2020.\n\n\n== Notable events ==\nOn April 21, 1914, Saugus High students staged a strike in support of Principal James F. Butterworth, who had resigned under pressure from the School Committee. The students returned the next day on the condition that School Committee hold a public hearing on Butterworth's resignation. The committee refused on the grounds that Butterworth was not entitled to one as he was not fired, but had voluntarily resigned. A special town meeting appointed a committee to investigate the matter. The committee sided with Butterworth and asked for the resignations of every member of the School Committee and the entire high school faculty. Despite the committee's decision, Butterwoth did not return to Saugus High; instead, he accepted the position of Superintendent of Schools in Bradford, Pennsylvania.In 1937, the school committee invited English teacher Isabelle Hallin to resign amid rumors that she had allegedly served cocktails to students during a drama club rehearsal at her home. Despite petitions and the picketing of Hallin's detractors' homes by students, the School Committee voted 3\u20132 against reappointing Hallin. Those who voted not to reappoint Hallin insisted that they did so on professional grounds. Hallin's picture appeared in many newspapers and she left Saugus to pursue a career in acting.On March 27, 1981, the entire 1200-member student body of Saugus High School walked out of class in protest of proposed school cutbacks as a result of Proposition 2\u00bd.In 1987, Saugus High hockey player Mike Maruzzi was paralyzed after he hit the boards head first and broke his neck.In 1994, two Saugus High School freshmen were expelled for smuggling a loaded, sawed-off shotgun onto school property.Saugus High School was closed for a week in 1998 while contractors removed asbestos from the auditorium, bathrooms, and second-floor balconies and hallways.In July 2004, the Saugus School Committee announced that budget cutbacks would result in the elimination of all sports and extracurricular activities. The extracurricular activities were restored by the beginning of the next school year after the district was able to receive extra funding from state.On November 14, 2006, Saugus High School was on high alert as a result of a bomb threat written in the girls' bathroom.On December 7, 2007, Saugus High School was put into lockdown and students were evacuated after a caller phoned in a gun threat.Following the 2012\u201313 winter break, Principal Joseph Diorio did not return to school and was not seen for several weeks. On January 9, Superintendent Richard Langlois announced that Diorio had been on paid leave since December 18 pending an inquiry \"

His regular position is scrum-half.\n\n\n== Rugby career ==\n\n\n=== 2010\u20132015: Schoolboy rugby ===\nPapier was born in Clanwilliam in the Western Cape. As early as primary school level, he earned provincial colours by representing the Boland Cavaliers at the 2010 Under-13 Craven Week tournament held in Graaff-Reinet.He then moved to Pretoria, where he enrolled at Ho\u00ebrskool Garsfontein. In 2013, he represented the Blue Bulls at the Under-16 Grant Khomo Week held in Vanderbijlpark, starting all three of their matches and scoring a try in their match against Eastern Province.In 2014, despite still being in the Under-17 age bracket, he was included in the Blue Bulls squad for the Under-18 Craven Week, South Africa's premier rugby union tournament at high school level. He started all three matches at the tournament held in Middelburg, scoring a try in their 36\u201315 victory over KwaZulu-Natal. After the tournament, he was included in a South Africa Schools team that hosted the Under-18 International Series against their counterparts from France, Wales and England. Papier played off the bench in their 28\u201313 victory over France in their opening match, but was promoted to the starting line-up for their second match against Wales, scoring a try in their 40\u201315 victory. He was again used as a replacement for their final match against England, but could not prevent South Africa suffering a 22\u201330 defeat.Papier had a similar season in 2015; he started all three of the Blue Bulls' matches at the Craven Week in Stellenbosch, scoring a try in their 40\u201312 victory over his home province Boland.

He started their opening match in Pool C of the tournament on the bench, appearing for the final eight minutes as South Africa came from behind to beat Japan 59\u201319. He did not feature in their second pool match, a 13\u201319 defeat to Argentina, but started their final match, scoring South Africa's first try in the match as they bounced back to secure a 40-31 bonus-point victory over France. The result meant South Africa secured a semi-final place as the best runner-up in the competition, but Papier suffered an ankle injury during a training session, which ended his involvement in the tournament. South Africa faced three-time champions England in their semi-final match, but the hosts proved too strong for them, knocking them out of the competition with a 39\u201317 victory, and they also lost the third-place play-off match against Argentina, as the South American side beat South Africa for the second time in the tournament, convincingly winning 49\u201319 to condemn South Africa to fourth place in the competition.\nPapier recovered from his injury towards the end of the 2016 Under-19 Provincial Championship, starting the Blue Bulls' final two matches of the regular season. He scored a try in the first of those, a 62\u20137 victory over Leopards U19, before he helped the Blue Bulls secure second place on the log with a 50\u201330 victory over Western Province U19. He also started their semi-final match against Golden Lions U19, but a 34\u201324 victory for the team from Johannesburg ended the Blue Bulls' participation in the competition.In November 2016, Papier was named in the Bulls Super Rugby team's extended training squad during the team's preparations for the 2017 Super Rugby season.\n\n\n=== 2019-2020: Sale Sharks ===\nIn September 2019, Papier joined Premiership rugby union side Sale Sharks on a three-month loan deal as Rugby World Cup cover for compatriot Faf de Klerk.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEmbrose Papier at Springboks.rugby"

The nature center and surrounding parkland is operated by the Peoria Park District to interpret and celebrate the elevational bluffs and oak savannahs of the Peoria Lake watershed, which in CE 1492 was one of the most fertile and productive ecosystems known to humankind.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Forest Park Nature Center contains a small natural history museum, with an emphasis on oak-hickory synergies on a soil of sandy loess.  A model chinquapin oak anchors the museum  display.  While loess soils are vulnerable to erosion, the root systems of the oaks, hickories, and other trees of the Forest Park ecosystem keep that section of the fragile bluffs from slumping into Lake Peoria.  The natural history displays explain the roots of trees, prairie grasses, and flowers, and how the roots of individual plants work together to form a combined root system.Around the Nature Center, 500 acres (200 hectares) of dedicated parkland (including a parcel granted standing as an Illinois State Nature Preserve) contains 7 miles (11 km) of hiking trails for field observations of the lessons learned in the center.  The trails concentrate on the forested woodlands of the Lake Peoria bluffland, with some of the earthen pathways jumping in and out of small, grassy tallgrass prairie openings.\n\n\n== References =="

It is a plectrum made by hand from a continuous strand of iron used to strike the strings of the sitar. Although it is generally worn on the index finger, a second mezrab is sometimes worn on the middle or little finger. The mezrab fits tightly on the end of the finger so that it does not move while playing, intended to be projected roughly 1/4 inch from the end of the finger.  \nMezrab is also the name for the lightweight wooden hammer used to play the Persian santur.\n\n\n== Different strokes used ==\nThere are four different Bols (strokes) used when playing sitar: Da, Ra, Dir and Dra. \n\nDa Bol - When the stroke is from outward to inward on the first string.\nRa Bol - When the stroke is from inward to outward on the first string.\nDir Bol - When the first string is stroked rapidly from both sides.

"Tax_reform| Tax reform| ","Tax reform is the process of changing the way taxes are collected or managed by the government and is usually undertaken to improve tax administration or to provide economic or social benefits. Tax reform can include reducing the level of taxation of all people by the government, making the tax system more progressive or less progressive, or simplifying the tax system and making the system more understandable or more accountable.\nNumerous organizations have been set up to reform tax systems worldwide, often with the intent to reform income taxes or value added taxes into something considered more economically liberal.  Other reforms propose tax systems that attempt to deal with externalities. Such reforms are sometimes proposed to be revenue-neutral, for example in revenue neutrality of the FairTax, meaning they ought not result in more tax or less being collected. Georgism claims that various forms of land tax can both deal with externalities and improve productivity.\n\n\n== Australia ==\nTax reform is an increasingly significant issue on the Australian political agenda. Combined annual deficits of the Commonwealth and State and territory governments will rise from 1.9% of gross domestic product in 2011\u201312 to 5.9% of GDP by 2049\u201350. Widespread, wholesale tax reform in Australia has not occurred since the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax in 2000. The Henry Tax Review identified 138 areas for significant reform to Australia's tax system over the next 10 to 20 years.\nIn July 2013, PricewaterhouseCoopers proposed significant tax reform in the context of an ageing population and slowing of the Australian mining boom. PricewaterhouseCoopers proposed improving the efficiency of the Australian tax system through analysing the competitiveness of the levels of taxation, its effect on production and the importance of broad-based taxes to reduce economic distortion. For example, over 115 other taxes raise less revenue than one tax: the Goods and Services Tax. This report received widespread coverage in the Australian press.\n\n\n== United States ==\n\nThere have been many movements in the United States to reform the collection and management of taxes.\nDuring the late 19th century, American economist Henry George started a global movement for tax reform. The aim of the movement was the abolition of all forms of taxation other than the Single Tax on land value. The effects of the movement on taxation policy, although diminished, can be seen in many parts of the world including Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. Efforts to promote this form of tax reform in the United States continue under the aegis of organizations such as The Henry George Foundation of America.In 1986, landmark tax reform was passed in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. In the 1990s, reform proposals arose over the double-taxation of corporate income, with a large report in 1992 by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).During the Bush administration, the President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform recommended the removal of the Alternative Minimum Tax. Several organizations are working for tax reform in the United States including Americans for Tax Reform, Americans For Fair Taxation and Americans Standing for the Simplification of the Estate Tax (ASSET). Various proposals have been put forth for tax simplification in the United States, including the FairTax and various flat tax plans and bipartisan tax reform proposals.In 2010, Fareed Zakaria proposed what he described as a \"

The geographical area for teams in South West Division One covered an area of south-west England from Oxfordshire and Berkshire in the east to Cornwall in the west. There were eleven teams in the league and they played each team once, giving each team ten matches. The other tier five leagues were London 1, Midlands 1 and North 1. This system prevailed for five seasons, and in 1992\u201393 the number of teams increased from eleven to thirteen. The following season (1993\u201394) the league was reorganised and the four tier five leagues became two; National 5 North and National 5 South. After three seasons, in 1996\u201397, a further reorganisation occurred, and there was a return to four, tier five leagues; with South West Division One covering the area of south-west England from Berkshire westwards. This system prevailed until 2009\u201310 when the number of teams was increased from twelve to fourteen and renamed National League Three South West. There was a name change for the beginning of season 2017\u201318 when the division was renamed the South West Premier.\n\n\n=== South West 1 (1987\u20131993) ===\nThe original South West 1 was a tier 5 league with promotion up to Area League 2 South and relegation down to South West 2 (presently split into two leagues known as South West 1 East and South West 1 West).\n\n\n=== South West 1 (1993\u201396) ===\nThe top six teams from South West 1 and the top six from London 1 were combined to create National 5 South.  South West 1 dropped to become a tier six league and was one of two feeder leagues for National 5 South.  Relegation continued to South West 2 (currently South West 1 East and South West 1 West).\n\n\n=== South West 1 (1996\u20132009) ===\nAt the end of the 1995\u201396 season National 5 South was discontinued and South West 1 returned to being a tier 5 league.  Promotion was up to National 4 South (now known as National League 2 South), while the splitting of South West 2 into two regional divisions, meant that relegation was now down to either South West 2 East or South West 2 West (currently South West 1 East / South West 1 West).\n\n\n=== National League 3 South West (2009\u20132017) ===\nThe division was renamed National League 3 South West following a restructuring of the national leagues which led to changes at all levels.  It remained a tier 5 league with promotion up to National League 2 South (formerly National League 3 South) and relegation to either South West 1 East or South West 1 West (formerly South West 2 East / South West 2 West).\n\n\n=== South West Premier (2017\u2013present) ===\nFor the 2017\u201318 season all divisions at tier 5 were renamed from National League 3 to Premier meaning that National League 3 South West became known as South West Premier.  Promotion continued to National League 2 South and relegation to either South West 1 East or South West 1 West.\n\n\n== Promotion play-offs ==\nSince the 2000\u201301 season there has been a promotion play-off game between the runners-up of London & South East Premier and South West Premier for the third and final promotion place to National League 2 South with the team with the superior league record having home advantage. As of the 2019\u201320 season the London and south-east teams have been most successful with thirteen wins to the south-west teams six while the home side have won fifteen of the nineteen ties.\n\n\n== Number of league titles ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nSouth West Division RFU\nEnglish rugby union system\nRugby union in England\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRugby union in the South West\nSouth West Premier fixtures at the RFU"

After an unsuccessful attempt at farming on a family estate, he began a wandering life abroad. In 1883 he went to the United States and eked out a living as a teacher, a carpenter, and a soldier, before returning to Europe in 1885. In 1886, he traveled to England and joined the British army as a soldier in the Middlesex Regiment (under the name of Thomas Edward Hallan). He went with his regiment to India in the following year. However, his army career in India proved a failure. He was much troubled by disease, and by then his drinking had developed into full-blown alcoholism, possibly in combination with the use of narcotic drugs. Nevertheless, he spent time on language studies, obviously in preparation for one of the language examinations that formed part of the British administrative system in India. He states that he learnt Hindustani (i.e., Urdu) and also started to learn Persian. There is, however, no record showing that he had passed any examination in these subjects.

Upon distinguishing himself during his command of two cruisers in the First Sino-Japanese War, Sait\u014d rose rapidly to the rank of rear admiral by 1900. He was promoted to vice admiral during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. After serving as Minister of the Navy from 1906 to 1914, Sait\u014d held the position of Governor-General of Korea from 1919 to 1927 and again from 1929 to 1931. When Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated in May 1932, he took his place as Prime Minister and served one term in office. Sait\u014d returned to public service as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal in February 1935 but was assassinated only a year later during the February 26 Incident.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nSait\u014d was born in Mizusawa Domain, Mutsu Province (part of present-day \u014csh\u016b City Iwate Prefecture), as the son of a samurai of the Mizusawa Clan. In 1879, he graduated from the 6th class Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, ranking third out of a class of 17 cadets. He was commissioned an ensign on September 8, 1882, and promoted to sub-lieutenant on February 25, 1884.\n\n\n== Military career ==\nIn 1884, Sait\u014d went to the United States for four years to study as a military attach\u00e9. Promoted to lieutenant on July 14, 1886; in 1888, after returning to Japan, he served as a member of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff.\nAfter his promotion to lieutenant commander on December 20, 1893, he served as executive officer on the cruiser Izumi and battleship  Fuji.\nDuring the First Sino-Japanese War, Sait\u014d served as captain of the cruisers Akitsushima and Itsukushima. He received rapid promotions to commander on December 1, 1897 and to captain on December 27. On November 10, 1898, he became Vice Minister of the Navy, and was promoted to rear admiral on May 20, 1900\n\n\n== Political career ==\nSait\u014d was again Vice Navy Minister at the start of the Russo-Japanese War. He was promoted to vice admiral on June 6, 1904. He was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (1st class) in 1906. After the end of the war, he served as Navy Minister for 8 years, from 1906 to 1914, during which time he continually strove for expansion of the navy.\nOn September 21, 1907, Sait\u014d was ennobled with the title of danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system. On October 16, 1912, he was promoted to full admiral. However, on April 16, 1914, Sait\u014d was forced to resign from his post as Navy Minister due implications of his involvement in the Siemens scandal, and officially entered the reserves.\nIn September 1919, Sait\u014d was appointed as the third Japanese Governor-General of Korea. Rising to the post right after the culmination of the Korean independence movement, he was subject to an immediate assassination attempt by Kang Woo-kyu, a radical Korean nationalist. He served as governor-general of Korea twice\u2014in 1919\u20131927, and again in 1929\u20131931, implementing a series of measures to moderate Japan's policies on Koreans. He was awarded the Order of the Paulownia Flowers in 1924. On April 29, 1925, his title was elevated to that of shishaku (viscount).\nIn 1927, Sait\u014d was a member of the Japanese delegation at the Geneva Naval Conference on Disarmament, and he later became a privy councillor.\n\n\n== Prime Minister ==\nFollowing the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi on May 15, 1932 by fanatical navy officers who thought Inukai far too conciliatory (the May 15 Incident), Prince Saionji Kinmochi, one of the Emperor's closest and strongest advisors, attempted to stop the slide towards a military take-over of the government. In a compromise move, Sait\u014d was chosen to be Inukai's successor. Sadao Araki remained as War Minister and immediately began making demands on the new government. During Sait\u014d's tenure, Japan recognized the independence of Manchukuo, and withdrew from the League of Nations.\nSait\u014d's administration was one of the longer-serving ones of the inter-war period, and it continued until July 8, 1934, when the cabinet resigned en masse because of the Teijin Incident bribery scandal. Keisuke Okada succeeded as prime minister.\nSait\u014d continued to be an important figure in politics as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal from December 26, 1935, but was assassinated during the February 26 Incident of 1936 at his home in Yotsuya, Tokyo. Takahashi, his predecessor, was shot dead the same day, along with several other top-rank politicians targeted by the rebels.\nSait\u014d was posthumously awarded the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nFrom the corresponding article in the Japanese Wikipedia\n\n\n=== Peerages ===\nBaron (21 September 1907)\nViscount (9 April 1925)\n\n\n=== Decorations ===\nOrder of the Sacred Treasure, Fourth Class (20 June 1899; Fifth Class: 25 November 1896; Sixth Class: 26 May 1893)\nOrder of the Golden Kite, Second Class (1 April 1906; Fourth Class: 23 May 1896)\nGrand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun (1 April 1906; Second Class: 27 December 1901; Sixth Class: 23 May 1896)\nGrand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun with Paulownia Flowers (11 February 1924)\nGrand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum (26 February 1936; posthumous)\n\n\n=== Foreign decorations ===\n United Kingdom: Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) (15 May 1906)\n Kingdom of Prussia: Order of the Red Eagle, Knight 1st Class (26 February 1907)\n Kingdom of Italy: Knight Grand Class of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus (1 July 1907)\n France: Grand Officer of the Legion d'Honneur (17 December 1907; Commander: 4 April 1901)\n Netherlands: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Orange-Nassau (31 May 1911)\n Holy See:\nKnight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Sylvester (17 January 1922)\nKnight Grand Cross of the Order of Pius IX (23 January 1932)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBix, Herbert P.

"River_Ash,_Surrey| Rivers of London| Rivers of Surrey| ","The River Ash is a small, shallow river in Surrey, England. Its course of 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) is just outside Greater London. Work has been carried out to re-align, clear, build up a small, Littleton head of water and create two backwaters.  One backwater dates to the medieval period; the other to the 1990s decade. It flows as one of the six distributaries of the River Colne from the south of Staines Moor immediately south of the Staines Bypass eastwards through the rest of the borough of Spelthorne before meeting the River Thames.\nIt is not navigable to craft and is rich in plant and insects, particularly reeds, diverse sedges (many of which commonly called bulrushes), pond-skaters, amphibians and lepidoptera (moths and butterflies). It enhances the Ash Link Nature Reserve, Studios Walk woodland biodiversity site and two parks. It is recognised as a key ecological feature within its Borough.\n\n\n== Course ==\nThe river is a distributary of the Colne. It forms the traditional boundary of Staines-upon-Thames first with Stanwell then with Ashford.  It then turns southward and splits Littleton (specifically the Queen Mary Reservoir, then a thin nature reserve by Shepperton Studios) from Laleham. It then resumes eastward. It is the northern limit of diminutive, near-square Shepperton Green \u2014 the western third of which was for centuries an southern outcrop (projection) of Littleton, and remains so in the Anglican church system.  Eighteen-hole Sunbury Golf Course on high-landscaped former municipal waste landfill then opposes a little of Shepperton across the banks.  Then a farm of Green Belt straddles the river partly in outer lands of Sunbury-on-Thames.  The river joins the Thames, flowing gently into the Creek \u2013 a secondary weirstream of the Thames \u2013 facing a long residential island: Wheatley's Ait. It marks two streets' garden ends, many of which have built footbridges.  The five urban centres in the borough are well over 500 m away, which has spared it from pollution and supported its biodiversity. Three parks feature the river such as a long walk in Fordbridge Park, Ashford.  Canoeists avoid the river when deep enough to canoe due to short barrages, extreme narrows and culverts.\n\n\n== Flow ==\nIn terms of flow of the distributaries, it is mid-ranked:\n\nflow exceeds:\nSweeps Ditch, Staines (perhaps no longer a distributary of the Colne since building works in the 1970s)\nThe long but ornamental Duke of Northumberland's River\nThe Longford River.\nflow normally dwarves:\nthe short final main Colne channel\nthe Colne Brook\nthe River Wraysbury which just rejoins the Colne tens of metres from the Thames (so is more properly a later corollary) acting as a distributary.\n\n\n== Soil divide and water characteristics ==\nAlluvium on gravel (save for London Clay outcrops, such as Harrow on the Hill, Hampstead Heath and the Grim's Ditch (Harrow)) is the soil setting of the north bank, west of the City of London as far as the Chiltern Hills.  As to topsoil the river marks a divide between permeable shallow gravelly topsoil for many miles to the north and almost impermeable alluvium to the south.  A very thin, agriculturally prosperous alluvial belt by the River Thames 0.6 miles (0.97 km) to 3 miles (4.8 km) away was caused by deposition from seasonal floods. This prevents for the whole course the rivers joining despite their proximity.  As the gravel former terraces of the Thames very gently slope from north to south no abrupt halts to the water table exist no springs arise and only modest interaction with the Thames Basin's water table. The sources are water from the Colne and run-off principally of a fresh water waterworks.\n\n\n=== Water quality ===\nWater quality is ordinarily clean given improvements in the effluent treatment works along the quite populous Colne valley \u2013 for a low-gradient river eutrophication and deposition is moderate to low.  The river is recognised as a key ecological feature within its Borough.The Environment Agency measures the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.Water quality of the River Ash in 2019:\n\n\n== History ==\nAshford gains its name from the river, forming the southern limit of all but its east half (ex-manor demesne and Common). Relevant maps date to medieval times, showing course changes, some clearly man-made. The earliest at close resolution recounts various channels by Shepperton Studios (Littleton Manor demesne), commissioned by the Lord of Shepperton Manor, two miles to the south. This refers to the monks of Westminster, who caused the local widening into heads of water as fish \"
"OR51F2| Genes on human chromosome 11| Olfactory receptors| Transmembrane receptor stubs| ","Olfactory receptor 51F2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the OR51F2 gene.Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOlfactory receptor\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOR51F2+protein,+human at the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)This article incorporates text from the United States National Library of Medicine, which is in the public domain."

He also finds the burnt body of Rebecca One lying near Drake. Jiggs rescues Drake and carries him to the Topsoil. At the same time, Elliott and Will are trapped in the inner world, in the destroyed city of New Germania. They meet three New Germanians who have survived the virus released in the inner world and, along with them and a Bushman called Woody, they go to explore one of the Pyramids from the jungle. Also, they find out that the Bushmen are part Styx (because they speak the Styx language at a much higher pitch). After they get into the Pyramid, something unexpected happens as Elliott touches a trident sign (like the ones that Dr. Burrows and Will found on their first exploration of the Pyramid). The Pyramid vanishes into thin air and an enormous tower appears out of nowhere in the jungle. Elliott senses that there is something missing from the tower, then she and Will find out that at the top of the tower there is a portal to Topsoil, and so they teleport themselves to London.\nMeanwhile, Chester is Topsoil with Stephanie, Old Wilkie, and Parry. Still grieving over the deaths of his parents during Professor Danforth's betrayal in the previous book, he discovers that Parry is still allied with Danforth and the death of his parents was being part of a plan. He then runs away from the others with Martha.\nDanforth is infiltrated within the Styx, but he soon finds out that, after he is no longer needed, he is sentenced to death by the Styx. He manages to save his life, taking prisoners Rebecca Two and her crush (Franz, the New Germanian driver).\nNow that they are finally Topsoil, Will and Elliott go to the British Museum because Elliott feels that she might find something very important there. She proves to be right and she finds a sceptre emanating a blue glow. When she and Will want to get out of the museum, they find themselves surrounded by Armagi. A tank driven by Drake and Jiggs suddenly appears. Elliott is saved, but Will is caught by the Styx.  Elliott senses that she has to go to St. Paul's Cathedral, as she somehow knows that by doing this she might put an end to the threat of the Armagi, who seem to be moving towards the rest of the world to conquer it.\nWhile Elliott, Drake and Jiggs are inside St. Paul's, Parry, Danforth and his team are watching them from the buildings around. As Danforth goes towards St. Paul's, trying to get through the Armagi, he is surrounded by Chester, Stephanie and Martha. Chester tries to kill Danforth but he is stopped by Stephanie and Martha. He gets angry and says some rude words to Martha, who kills him with her crossbow, then is elevated in the air and taken away by the Brights.\nElliott uses the sceptre and the dome of St. Paul's disappears just like the Pyramid from the inner world. Some Styx (including Rebecca Two and Alex) appear, carrying Will as a prisoner. Alex lays her eggs inside Will, in the view of everyone. As he tries to save Will, Drake gets shot and killed by two Limiters. Saving the situation, Elliott strikes the ground with the sceptre and all of the Armagi and Styx (including Elliott) get teleported inside the inner world, where they will all be killed by the virus, except for the vaccinated Elliott.\nAt the end of the book, Will finds himself inside a topsoil hospital, reunited with his mother and with Bartleby, one of the original Bartleby's kittens, who resembles his father. Elliott, who was trapped inside the Tower from the inner world, puts the sceptre in its place in the tower and suddenly the earth starts to move and get away from the Solar System. It is revealed that the Earth is a huge spaceship sent on a mission and, because the sceptre was stolen, the spaceship remained trapped in the Solar system. Now that the sceptre is again in its place, Earth starts its journey again towards Home. Will also finds out that, even though the eggs were removed, they may have turned him into a Styx.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nKirkus review\nThe Guardian review\n\n\n== External links ==\nTunnels Official Website\nTunnels Chicken House Publishing Ltd."

"Lodi,_Indiana| Unincorporated communities in Indiana| Unincorporated communities in Parke County, Indiana| ","Lodi (also called Fullerton, Gilderoy or Waterman) is an unincorporated community in Liberty Township, Parke County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. Located on State Hwy 234, the most prominent feature is Waterman Baptist Church, which occupies a red brick building in the north-east corner of town. Just south of the town is one of the first round barns, the W. H. York Round Barn, which was built in 1895.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nLazarus Shirk first settled on Coal Creek in 1826 followed by James Marks in March 1830. The town was platted as Fullerton by Peter Blakewell on April 11, 1836. It may have been named for Robert Fulton who built the first successful steamboat. Jesse Bowen and Elijah Thompson owned all of the land and the east hill was called Golderay.\n\n\n=== Renamings ===\nLess than a year later though the town would change its name to Lodi on January 26, 1837. It may have been named for the city of Lodi, Italy near Milan, Italy, where Napoleon won a great victory over the Austrians in 1796. The Post Office was officially call Lodiville.\nOnce again the town's name changed in 1857 to Waterman in honor of Dr. Waterman who had opened a pork packing plant and store in town. In 1874 an R.M. Waterman owned large coal fields north of town.\n\n\n=== Industry and Businesses ===\nThe Wabash and Erie Canal passed around Lodi on the west side and wrapped around the south side before crossing Coal Creek and continuing its journey south. A feeder dam was built on coal creek. The last canal boat to pass Lodi was in 1875 heading north to Lafayette.\nAlong with the pork packing plant by the 1880s Lodi's businesses included the Lewis Davis and Charles Bright flour mill, drug store, dry goods store, grocery store, two blacksmith shops, sawmill, Masonic Lodge, G.A.R. Post, and a school.\nNorth of town there was a health spa, that was built around the Lodi Artesian Well, that operated for many years. In 1913 the well was purchased by a group of Chicago capitalists. They installed a large pipe that allowed the well to flow into a basin. A large dance pavilion and a baseball diamond were built and the resort was most popular during the Depression. The dance pavilion was later converted to a roller skating rink and the well was used to fill the swimming pool. The business came to an end though when, in an attempt to clean the pipe, Fred Clingan instead plugged it.

In 2007, it was ported to the Nintendo DS as Cookie & Cream.\n\n\n== Story ==\nCookie (known as Chestnut in the European and Japanese versions) and Cream are two bunnies who are on their way home on the eve of their clan's 'Moon Festival'. However, during the journey home, they meet a messenger who tells them that the moon is gone and that if no one finds it there will never be another festival. After each of them is given a crown as a symbol of courage by the mysterious messenger, they go on a journey to get the moon back.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nPlayers can choose from two different modes: versus and story. In story mode (one or two players), players must guide Cookie and Cream to the goal before the time runs out. In one-player story mode the player controls both Cookie and Cream at the same time; in two-player mode each player controls one character. On the PS2 version, the two players can either use separate controllers, or they can both use the same controller, with one player holding the left side and the other the right side. Throughout the game, Cookie has to navigate through many obstacles. Most obstacles require Cookie or Cream to perform a specific action so the other is able to advance past the obstacles. Players can collect silver watches which add 20 seconds of time and gold watches which add 50 seconds of time as they play through the levels. Throughout the story mode players can collect puzzle pieces to unlock more characters in versus mode. In versus mode 2 to 4 players compete to collect as many points as possible before reaching the goal. Versus mode on the PS2 version also offers Multitap Support to allow the use of up to 4 controllers simultaneously.\n\n\n== Nintendo DS release ==\nIn 2007, the game was ported to the Nintendo DS as Cookie & Cream.The Nintendo DS version is reworked to account for the system's functions. Instead of both players doing platforming challenges in split screen, the first player does platforming on the top screen, and the second player performs contextual actions and puzzles with a stylus on the bottom screen. Like the PS2 version, Cookie & Cream can be played as either a single-player game where one person controls both characters, or a co-operative game where one player maneuvers Cookie while the other is in charge of Cream. Multiplayer is available able with both local wireless or via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Additional content includes a battle mode with 20 competitive mini-games that can be played with up to three other players.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe Adventures of Cookie & Cream received \"

"Cold-core_low| Meteorological phenomena| Tropical cyclone meteorology| Types of cyclone| Vortices| ","A cold-core low, also known as an upper level low or cold-core cyclone, is a cyclone aloft which has an associated cold pool of air residing at high altitude within the Earth's troposphere, without a frontal structure. It is a low pressure system that strengthens with height in accordance with the thermal wind relationship. If a weak surface circulation forms in response to such a feature at subtropical latitudes of the eastern north Pacific or north Indian oceans, it is called a subtropical cyclone. Cloud cover and rainfall mainly occurs with these systems during the day. \nSevere weather, such as tornadoes, can occur near the center of cold-core lows. Cold lows can help spawn cyclones with significant weather impacts, such as polar lows, and K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices. Cold lows can lead directly to the development of tropical cyclones, owing to their associated cold pool of air aloft or by acting as additional outflow channels to aid in further development.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nCold cyclones are stronger aloft than at the Earth's surface, or stronger in areas of the troposphere with lower pressures, per the thermal wind relationship and the hypsometric equation. The hypsometric equation dictates that colder atmospheres have less room between pressure surfaces, which corresponds to the concept of lower atmospheric thickness, and the thermal wind relation indicates that in this situation, the wind increases with height. It also means that an isolated pool of cold air aloft is associated with the feature. Because of its cold center, the center shows an area of thickness minimum. Since the temperature at any given radius is similar and parallel to the orientation of the pressure gradient, and therefore the wind, it is barotropic in nature. The movement of cold-core cyclones can be erratic since they are separated from the main belt of the Westerlies, which would otherwise steer them progressively to the east.Most cloud cover and precipitation in association with cold lows occurs during the daylight hours as sunlight warms the Earth's surface, destabilizing the atmosphere and causing upward vertical motion. The development of severe weather, particularly tornadoes, can occur near the center of these systems over land during any season of the year. During winter, when cold-core lows with temperatures in the mid-levels of the troposphere reach \u221245 \u00b0C (\u221249 \u00b0F) move over open waters, deep convection forms which allows polar low development to become possible.\n\n\n== Importance to cyclones within the subtropics and mid-latitudes ==\n\nKona lows, most extratropical cyclones, and tropical upper tropospheric cyclones are cold core lows. In the eastern half of the north Pacific ocean and north Indian ocean, the formation of a weak circulation underneath a mid to upper-tropospheric low which has cut off from the main belt of the westerlies during the cold season (winter) is called a subtropical cyclone. In the case of the north Indian ocean, the formation of this type of vortex leads to the onset of monsoon rains during the wet season.East coast lows form near and east of where a cold core low interacts with a sea surface temperature (SST) gradient along the east coast of continents, such as Asia, North America, southern Africa, and Australia within a pre-existing area of high pressure. Those offshore the East Coast of the United States, which normally form in the months between October and April, are termed nor'easters. Not initially associated with weather fronts, they form in tandem with blocking anticyclones at higher latitudes, which leads to a slow poleward movement up the SST gradient. East coast lows can persist for up to a week. Some East coast lows develop rapidly, becoming meteorological bombs. There is a 4.5 year cycle in the formation of East coast lows near Australia, in years in transition between warm (El Ni\u00f1o) and cold (La Ni\u00f1a) ENSO years. These systems can develop strong wind, heavy rains, waves over 10 metres (33 ft) in height, and eye features on weather satellite imagery.\n\n\n== Importance to tropical cyclones ==\n\nThe summer tropical upper tropospheric trough in the Southern Hemisphere lies over the trade wind region of the east central Pacific and can cause tropical cyclogenesis offshore Central America. In the western Pacific, tropical upper tropospheric lows are the main cause for the few tropical cyclones which develop north of the 20th parallel north and east of the 160th meridian east during La Ni\u00f1a events.Trailing upper cyclones and upper troughs can cause additional outflow channels and aid in the intensification process of tropical cyclones. Developing tropical disturbances can help create or deepen upper troughs or upper lows in their wake due to the outflow jet stream emanating from the developing tropical disturbance/cyclone. In the western North Pacific, there are strong reciprocal relationships between the areas of formative tropical cyclones and that of the lower tropospheric monsoon troughs and the tropical upper tropospheric trough. Tropical cyclone movement can also be influenced by TUTT cells within 1,700 kilometres (1,100 mi) of their position, which can lead to non-climatological tracks, such as eastward movement within the tropics or westward movement in an area where the Westerlies normally dominate.Normally, an ocean temperature of 26.5 \u00b0C (79.7 \u00b0F) spanning through a depth of at least 50 metres (160 ft) is one of the six requirements needed to maintain the special mesocyclone that is the tropical cyclone. Cooler air temperatures at a higher altitude (e.g., at the 500 hPa level, or 5.9 km) can lead to tropical cyclogenesis at lower water temperatures than normal, as a certain lapse rate is required to force the atmosphere to be unstable enough for convection. In a moist atmosphere, this lapse rate is 6.5 \u00b0C/km (19 \u00b0F/mi), while in an atmosphere with less than 100% relative humidity, the required lapse rate is 9.8 \u00b0C/km (29 \u00b0F/mi). A recent example of a tropical cyclone that maintained itself over cooler waters was Alex of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season, which became a hurricane over waters at only 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F).At the 500 hPa level, the air temperature averages \u22127 \u00b0C (18 \u00b0F) within the tropics, but air in the tropics is normally dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500 hPa in a tropical atmosphere of \u221213.2 \u00b0C (8.2 \u00b0F) is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is 26.5 \u00b0C (79.7 \u00b0F), and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1 \u00b0C in the sea surface temperature for each 1 \u00b0C change at 500 hpa. Under a cold cyclone, 500 hPa temperatures can fall as low as \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222 \u00b0F), which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the troposphere, roughly at the 500 hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the same height, temperatures at 500 hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres. At heights near the tropopause, the 30-year average temperature (as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990) was \u221277 \u00b0C (\u2212132 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== See also ==\nCut-off low\n\n\n== References =="

"Lacrosse_(satellite)| Lockheed Martin satellites and probes| Military space program of the United States| National Reconnaissance Office satellites| Synthetic aperture radar satellites| Satellite series| Military equipment introduced in the 1980s| ","Lacrosse or Onyx is a series of terrestrial radar imaging reconnaissance satellites operated by the United States National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). While not officially confirmed by the NRO or the Government of the United States prior to 2008, there was widespread evidence pointing to its existence, including one NASA website. In July 2008, the NRO itself declassified the existence of its synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite constellation.According to former Director of Central Intelligence Admiral Stansfield Turner, Lacrosse had its origins in 1950 (1980?)  when a dispute between the Central Intelligence Agency and the U.S. Air Force as to whether a combined optical/radar reconnaissance satellite (the CIA proposal) or a radar-only one (the USAF proposal) should be developed was resolved in favor of the USAF.\nLacrosse uses synthetic aperture radar as its prime imaging instrument.  It is able to see through cloud cover and also has some ability to penetrate soil, though there have been more powerful instruments deployed in space for this specific purpose.  Early versions are believed to have used the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) to relay imagery to a ground station at White Sands, New Mexico. There are some indications that other relay satellites may now be available for use with Lacrosse. The name Lacrosse is used to refer to all variants, while Onyx is sometimes used to refer to the three newer units.Unit costs (including launch) in 1990 dollars are estimated to be in the range of US$0.5 to 1.0 billion.\n\n\n== Future ==\nIt had been anticipated that the Lacrosse satellites would be replaced by the radar component of the Future Imagery Architecture (FIA). The severe program problems encountered by FIA in the early 2000s (decade)  led to a plan to off-load radar reconnaissance to the Space Based Radar, later simplified to Space Radar, with initial launch anticipated around 2015. This program itself was axed by Congress late 2008. The launch of NROL-41 (USA 215) in September 2010 has all orbital characteristics of a radar remote sensing platform (see FIA) and could be the first of a Lacrosse follow-up program. Its orbit is a retrograde version of the \"

"W%C5%82odowice,_Silesian_Voivodeship| Villages in Zawiercie County| Kraków Voivodeship (14th century – 1795)| Piotrków Governorate| Kielce Voivodeship (1919–1939)| ","W\u0142odowice [vw\u0254d\u0254\u02c8vit\u0361s\u025b] is a village in Zawiercie County, Silesian Voivodeship, in southern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina W\u0142odowice. It lies approximately 7 kilometres (4 mi) north of Zawiercie and 47 km (29 mi) north-east of the regional capital Katowice. The village has a population of 5,700.\nIt was formerly a town, and it is best known for its centre. The main road leading through Wlodowice is \u017barecka Street. The village has a Baroque church of St. Bartholomew and ruins of the Baroque W\u0142odowice Palace. W\u0142odowice is located in the middle of the Jura Krakowsko-Cz\u0119stochowska region, best known for its limestone rocks, such as those of the nearby village of Rz\u0119dkowice, carved on the seafloor millions of years ago.\nWlodowice has a long and rich history. Even though the village now lies in Silesian Voivodeship, it belongs to historical Lesser Poland, and was a town from mid-14th century to 1870. Until the Partitions of Poland, Wlodowice was part of Lel\u00f3w County, Krak\u00f3w Voivodeship.\n\n\n== Name ==\nFirst mentioned as Wlodowycze, in a document of Bishop of Krak\u00f3w Iwo Odrow\u0105\u017c (1220). In the 1470s, Jan D\u0142ugosz spelled the name Wlodowicze and Wlodowycza, while during World War II, the village was Germanized into Woldenstein.\nThe name probably comes from old Slavic given name Wlodowuj.\n\n\n== History ==\nWlodowice lies in Polish Jura, near the border between two historic provinces of Poland, Lesser Poland and Silesia. In Slavic times, pagan ceremonies took place on a nearby hill, Gora Glowienna. In 1220, Bishop of Krak\u00f3w Iwo Odrow\u0105\u017c named Wlodowycze as one of several villages, which had to send payments to the monastery at nearby Mstow. In 1241, Wlodowice was burned during the Mongol invasion of Poland, after which local residents rebuilt the village. In early 14th century, a parish church was established here, and in 1327, Wlodowice became property of King Wladyslaw Lokietek. Probably some time in the first half of the 14th century, Wlodowice received town charter, and in 1386, it was handed over to a local noble family.\nIn the second half of the 16th century, Wlodowice was one of the most important centers of Protestant Reformation in western Lesser Poland. At that time, the town belonged to the Boner family, which supported the movement, turning local parish church into a Calvinist prayer house. Nevertheless, Wlodowice remained a small town, which was completely burned during the catastrophic Swedish invasion of Poland (1655\u201360). On July 26, 1683, King Jan III Sobieski rested here on his way to the Battle of Vienna, and in early March 1734, King Augustus II the Strong also spent one night at a local palace, on his way from Krak\u00f3w to Cz\u0119stochowa.\nFollowing the Partitions of Poland, Wlodowice briefly belonged to the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1815, it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, in which it remained until World War I. In 1870, as a punishment for the January Uprising, Wlodowice lost its town charter.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJewish Community in W\u0142odowice on Virtual Shtetl"
"Sch%C3%B6nborn_family| Schönborn family| ","The Sch\u00f6nborn family [\u02c8\u0283\u00f8\u02d0nb\u0254rn] is a noble and mediatised formerly sovereign family of the former Holy Roman Empire.\nVarious members of the family have held high offices of the Roman Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire over the course of centuries, including as bishops, prince bishops, cardinals and prince-electors. In addition to several family members having been elected rulers of ecclesiastical principalities \u2014 the Electorate of Mainz, the Princely-Bishopric of W\u00fcrzburg, the Princely-Bishopric of Worms, the Princely-Bishopric of Speyer, the Electorate of Trier, and the Princely-Bishoprice of Bamberg \u2014 the family possessed a fief in Franconia that held imperial immediacy as a county within the Holy Roman Empire, the state of Sch\u00f6nborn.\nThe House of Sch\u00f6nborn, especially its ruling prelates of the Roman Catholic Church, were among the most important builders of Southern German baroque architecture. The family gave the name Sch\u00f6nbornzeit (Age of the Sch\u00f6nborns) to an era (1642\u20131756), sometimes nostalgically remembered in the popular consciousness as an era of prosperity. Today, the term Sch\u00f6nbornzeit denotes a particular style of Rhenish and Franconian baroque.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early History ===\nThe Sch\u00f6nborn family first appeared in the Rheingau region with H. von Sconenburne in 1275. Their original seat was Sch\u00f6nborn in the County of Katzenelnbogen. A secondary source of 1670 mentions an earlier Eucharius von Sch\u00f6nborn of the mid 12th century, however without documentary proof. The lion in their coat of arms may derive from the Katzenelnbogen as well as from the nearby Diez counts whose vassals they were. By the end of the 14th century, the family had split into three branches one of which extinguished soon. The elder branch resided at Sch\u00f6nborn and held the office of Burgmann at Burgschwalbach, a castle built between 1354 and 1371 by count Eberhard V. of Katzenelnbogen. Gilbrecht of Sch\u00f6nborn was mentioned there in 1373. They were also Burgmanns at Hahnst\u00e4tten in the County of Nassau. Several of them became abbots, one a grand bailiff of the Knights Hospitaller. The younger branch were vassals in the Westerwald region, in the service of the Barony of Westerburg, the Electorate of Trier, the Electorate of Mainz and the county of Wied. In the 16th century many younger sons of the family became Domherren (canons), leading to the extinction of both branches, with the exception of a side line of the younger branch that had received the fiefs of Freienfels (near Weinbach) and Eschbach (near Weilm\u00fcnster).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Later history ===\n\nJohann Philipp von Sch\u00f6nborn of Eschbach, son of a minor nobleman in the employ of the then Lutheran counts of Wied, became a Catholic priest in the impoverished times of the Thirty Years' War. He was admitted as a minor canon by the cathedral chapter of Wurzburg. At the time, the family consisted only of his brother and himself. These two brought the family to power and fame, founding new branches that were to become widely known throughout Europe. Johann Philipp became a priest at Wurzburg Cathedral at the age of 16, changed to Mainz Cathedral in 1625 and to Worms Cathedral in 1630. He became a provost and, in 1642, was elected prince-bishop of Wurzburg. His diplomatic skills made him an important mediator during the Peace of Westphalia negotiations that ended the Thirty Years' War in 1648. As a result, he was additionally elected Archbishop of Mainz in 1647, thus also ruler of the Electorate of Mainz and archchancellor of the Holy Roman empire. In 1663 he also received the princely-bishopric of Worms. He was an effective administrator of his principalities and was able to bring back economic recovery. He fortified the city of Mainz and founded hospitals and high schools. His court was a center of German politics in the post-war era. Johann Philipp was the first of six members of the Sch\u00f6nborn family who, in the course of more than three generations, were to rule over eight of the most prestigious ecclesiastical principalities of the Holy Roman Empire.\nHe made his brother Philip Erwein (1607\u20131668) a Vogt in the Electorate of Mainz where the latter acquired the castles of Gaibach in 1650, of Geisenheim in 1654 and of Heusenstamm (where he built a new castle) in 1661. In 1635 he married Maria Ursula von Greiffenclau-Vollraths, a close relative of the late archbishop and elector of Mainz Georg Friedrich von Greiffenklau; the couple had 12 children. In 1663 Philip Erwein became a baron. The family thus shifted its focus from its regions of origin, which had become predominantly Protestant, to the Catholic ecclesiastical principalities of the empire.\n\nPhilip Erwein's son, Lothar Franz von Sch\u00f6nborn, also became a prince-bishop of Wurzburg in 1693 and an elector-archbishop of Mainz in 1695. The latter's brother Melchior (1644\u20131717) acquired the fief of Reichelsburg (near Aub) from the prince-bishop of Wurzburg in 1671, giving him access to the Franconian Circle of the imperial knights.\nIn 1701, Melchior's son, Rudolf Franz (1677\u20131754), married Eleonore von Hatzfeld, widow of the Count von Dernbach, who had left her the Herrschaft Wiesentheid in Franconia, a small imperial state raised to a county in 1701. Thus, the family obtained imperial immediacy for the first time, and since the counts of Sch\u00f6nborn bear the prefix Illustrious Highness. She had also inherited the Austrian fiefs of Arnfels and Waldenstein in Carinthia from her first husband. Melchior then bought some further estates in Austria in 1710, G\u00f6llersdorf with M\u00fchlberg and Aspersdorf in Lower Austria, from the Counts of Buchheim. In 1717, his estate was partitioned into the states of Sch\u00f6nborn-Wiesentheid and Sch\u00f6nborn-Heusenstamm, both retaining immediacy. Heusenstamm was inherited by Sch\u00f6nborn-Wiesentheid in 1801. The state of Sch\u00f6nborn-Wiesentheid was mediatised in 1806.\nIn 1726, Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, granted Palanok Castle with Mukacheve, Chynadiyovo and 200 villages in the Kingdom of Hungary (today part of the Ukraine), to Elector Lothar Franz, after the latter had sent him troops to defeat Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, whose property it had been. The estate, one of the largest in Eastern Europe, remained in the family well into the 20th century.\n\nIn the year 1743, members of the family ruled the following states, all sovereign princely-bishoprics within the Holy Roman Empire: Bamberg, W\u00fcrzburg, Konstanz, Speyer, Worms and Trier, while the archdiocese and electorate of Mainz (and thus archchancellorship of Germany, a position that two Sch\u00f6nborns had held shortly before) were held by a close relative, Johann Friedrich Karl von Ostein. Not only were important parts of Southern Germany under their control, but also quite wealthy regions. The Sch\u00f6nborns were not restricted to ruling these territories. They followed through, over several generations, with one of the most ambitious building programs of the 18th century, including churches, monasteries, ecclesiastical residences, schools and hospitals. Again, in the 19th and 20th/21st centuries, two Sch\u00f6nborns rose to become archbishops and cardinals. Given that the family had started under modest conditions with Johann Philipp in the early 17th century, this success was the result of piety, loyalty to the Catholic church and its strongest supporter in Europe, the House of Habsburg, ambition, diligence, organizational skills, grandiosity in planning, solid finances, advantageous marriages and overall, an iron will in pursuit of their goals through centuries. The House of Sch\u00f6nborn, initially rather impoverished knights, thus managed to surpass many of the more powerful older dynasties and to leave an enormous cultural legacy.\nAt the end of the 18th century, three brothers, who were great-grandsons of Rudolf Franz (1677\u20131754), established the three extant branches of the family:\n\nFranz Philipp (1768\u20131841) founded the Austrian branch, Sch\u00f6nborn-Buchheim, until today owning the G\u00f6llersdorf and Weyerburg estates and Palais Sch\u00f6nborn-Batthy\u00e1ny in Vienna;\nFranz Erwein (1776\u20131840) founded the Franconian branch (in Bavaria), Sch\u00f6nborn-Wiesentheid, until today owning the castles at Wiesentheid, Pommersfelden, Gaibach, Geisenheim and the wine estates Hallburg near Volkach and Hattenheim, and formerly also owning property in Bohemia; and\nFriedrich (1781\u20131849) founded the Bohemian branch, Sch\u00f6nborn, residing at Sch\u00f6nborn Palace (Prague), today the U.S. embassy, and until 1945 at Skalka Castle, Czech Republic.\n\n\n== Rulers of Sch\u00f6nborn ==\n\n\n=== Lords of Sch\u00f6nborn (1385\u20131663) ===\nGerard (1385\u20131416)\nGerard (1416\u20131460)\nJohn II (1460\u20131490)\nJohn IV (1490\u20131529)\nGeorge II (1529\u20131560)\nPhilip (1560\u20131589)\nGeorge IV (1589\u20131613)\nPhilip Erwin (1613\u20131668), since 1663 Baron\n\n\n=== Barons of Sch\u00f6nborn (1663\u20131701) ===\nPhilip Erwin (1663\u20131668)\nJohn Erwin (1668\u20131705), since 1701 Count, jointly with:\n\n\n=== Counts of Sch\u00f6nborn (1701\u20131717) ===\nJohn Erwin (1701\u20131705)\nMelchior Frederick (1705\u20131717)Divided between the lines Heusenstamm and Wiesentheid.\n\n\n=== After German Mediatisation ===\n\n\n== Counts of Sch\u00f6nborn-Buchheim ==\nFrancis George (1682\u20131756)\n\n\n=== After German Mediatisation ===\n\n\n== Counts of Sch\u00f6nborn-Heusenstamm (1717\u20131801) ==\n\nSch\u00f6nborn-Heusenstamm was a German statelet ruled by the Sch\u00f6nborn family located in the south of modern Hesse, Germany.

It was the site of the first British settlement in Van Diemen's Land, now Tasmania, the island state of Australia.  The cove was named by John Hayes,\nwho mapped the river in the ship Duke of Clarence in 1794, after his second officer William Bellamy Risdon.\n\nIn 1803 Lieutenant John Bowen was sent to establish a settlement in Van Diemen's Land.  On the advice of the explorer George Bass he had chosen Risdon Cove. While the site was a good one from a defensive point of view, the soil was poor and water scarce.\nLady Nelson anchored at Risdon on the eastern shore of the Derwent River on Wednesday 8 September 1803, five days before the whaler Albion arrived with Lt. Bowen on board.\nThe 49 people aboard the Lady Nelson and Albion made a curious party of soldiers, sailors, settlers and convicts.\nIn 1804 Lieutenant Colonel David Collins arrived in the Derwent from Port Phillip on Ocean. Within a few days he rejected Risdon Cove as a suitable settlement site, for its inadequate source of fresh water, and moved his party across the river to Sullivans Cove. The military and convicts disembarked from Ocean near Hunter Island on 20\u201321 February 1804 and thus beginning what is now Hobart. Lady Nelson landed the free settlers at New Town Bay on 22 February.\nOne of the first land grants at Risdon Cove was made to Dr William F A I'Anson, the chief surgeon who arrived with Lieutenant-Governor Collins in 1804.\n\n\n== 3 May 1804 ==\n\nThe original records show that a large group of Aborigines walked into the fledling settlement.

The Aborigines had arrived at the settlement and some were justifiably upset by the presence of the colonists. There had been no widespread aggression, but if their displeasure spread and escalated, Lt. Moore, the commanding officer at the time, and his dozen or so soldiers, could not be expected to be able to protect the settlement from a mob of such size.

Every Sunday a priest from Bandra would come to Santacruz and offer mass for Catholics residing in the traditional Gaothans (village). In the early twentieth century, many Catholics from Goa, Mangalore and Kerala began migrating to Bombay. These people settled in Santacruz since Bombay's traditional catholic localities like Colaba and Byculla were overcrowded. The Sacred Heart Church was completed in 1936 to cater to the spiritual needs of this growing population.\n\n\n== References =="

These plants may actually be representatives of Atriplex serenana, and it is possible that A. tularensis is in fact extinct.The plants are endemic to the alkali soils of the local occasionally flooded salt pan. Much of the land in the San Joaquin Valley was claimed and altered for agriculture and the water table dropped, making conditions too dry for reproduction of many species, including this Atriplex. The small lakebed where this species may be extant was formerly tended by The Nature Conservancy, but it is now privately owned.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAtriplex tularensis is an erect, reddish-green or grayish annual herb growing up to 80 centimeters tall. The leaves are up to 3 centimeters long and oval to lance-shaped. Leaves and stem branches are white-scaly and tough.\nThe male and female flowers are small, hard clusters. The female fruit-producing flowers have associated bracts which end in a sharp point. This characteristic differentiates A. tularensis from Atriplex cordulata, which is otherwise very similar in appearance. A. tularensis is listed as an endangered species on the California state level, but not on the federal level.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJepson Manual Treatment - Atriplex tularensis\nUSDA Plants Profile: Atriplex tularensis"
"Quenching_(scrubber)| Chemical processes| Pollution control technologies| Air pollution control systems| Scrubbers| Wet scrubbers| ","Quenching, in the context of pollution scrubbers, refers to the cooling of hot exhaust gas by water sprays before it enters the scrubber proper. Hot gases (those above ambient temperature) are often cooled to near the saturation level. If not cooled, the hot gas stream can evaporate a large portion of the scrubbing liquor, adversely affecting collection efficiency and damaging scrubber internal parts. If the gases entering the scrubber are too hot, some liquid droplets may evaporate before they have a chance to contact pollutants in the exhaust stream, and others may evaporate after contact, causing captured particles to become reentrained. In some cases, quenching can actually save money. Cooling the gases reduces the temperature and, therefore, the volume of gases, permitting the use of less expensive construction materials and a smaller scrubber vessel and fan.\n\n\n== Design ==\nA quenching system can be as simple as spraying liquid into the duct just preceding the main scrubbing vessel, or it can be a separate chamber (or tower) with its own spray system identical to a spray tower. Quenchers are designed using the same principles as scrubbers. Increasing the gas-liquid contact in them increases their operational efficiency. \n\n\n== Sizing ==\nSmall liquid droplets cool the exhaust stream more quickly than large droplets because they evaporate more easily. Therefore, less liquid is required. However, in most scrubbing systems, approximately one-and-a-half to two and- a-half times the theoretical evaporation demand is required to ensure proper cooling. Evaporation also depends on time; it does not occur instantaneously. Therefore, the quencher should be sized to allow for an adequate exhaust stream residence time. Normal residence times range from 0.15 to 0.25 seconds for gases under 540\u00b0C (1000\u00b0F) to 0.2 to 0.3 seconds for gases hotter than 540\u00b0C.\n\n\n== Recirculation ==\nQuenching with recirculated scrubber liquor could potentially reduce overall scrubber performance, since recycled liquid usually contains a high level of suspended and dissolved solids. As the liquid droplets evaporate, these solids could become re-entrained in the exhaust gas stream. To help reduce this problem, clean makeup water can be added directly to the quench system rather than adding all makeup water to a common sump.\n\n\n== References =="

Having left school at 17 he started full-time work in a local men\u2019s fashion shop, moving to London at the age of 19. He worked in the King's Road before accepting a position as a salesman at a tailor's shop on Savile Row owned by menswear pioneer and supplier of clothing to rock stars and celebrities John Michael Ingram. As a sideline, Hackett bought and sold second hand clothes purchased from the London street markets and, through this, met up with Ashley Lloyd-Jennings, who shared similar tastes in fashion. They opened Hackett's first store on the King's Road in 1983. Hackett claims that he was at least partly responsible for starting the much-mocked red trousers trend in London, telling Esquire \u201cWe used to sell red trousers and lots of the Sloane types used to come in and buy them, and it just spread from there,\u201d but insisted \u201cI\u2019d never wear them though.\u201d\n\n\n== Style guidance ==\nThe Hackett brand grew quickly and Jeremy Hackett has also become well known as an authority on men's fashion particularly in classic style.

The train crash killed 12 people, including 11 children, and injured three others. The disaster was the worst in the history of Clinton County.\n\n\n== Accident ==\nOn 7 February 1976, a freight train traveling on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from Washington, Indiana to East St. Louis, Illinois departed. The train was 70 cars long and consisted of 36 empty freight cars, 31 loaded freight cars, and three diesel freight cars. The train had three crew members, two in the locomotive and one in the caboose. At 6:45 p.m. the freight train was approaching the small town of Beckemeyer, Illinois.At the same time 60-year-old Henry Lowe was driving his 1967 GMC pickup truck bringing 15 people, mostly children, to a roller skating party in Highland, Illinois. Six individuals were in the cab of the truck and another 10 were in the bed. Henry Lowe was traveling to the west on Beckemeyer Street going between 15 to 18 mph (24-29 kph). The truck turned left onto Scoville Street and continued south towards the railroad tracks without changing speed. At 6:50 p.m. the train struck the truck going 56 mph (90 kph).\n\nAs soon as the train hit the truck the engineer of the train, O.J Coers threw on the emergency braking system in an attempt to stop the train. The front coupler of the train hit the truck near the driver's side door and ripped the body off the truck and threw it to the right of the train. The train continued down the tracks for another 2,500 feet (762 meters) before stopping with the truck\u2019s cab and chassis still wrapped around the front of the train.Six of those killed were found north of the impact site after being thrown from the truck, another six were carried with the truck, and only four were found inside the cab. The injured from the train crash were quickly taken to St. Joseph's Hospital in Breese, Illinois by bystanders. The crash completely destroyed the truck and killed 11 children and Henry Lowe himself. Three people were left with serious injuries and only one person survived without serious injury. The crash was the worst single disaster in Clinton County's history.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nOn 8 February 1976, a two-man team from the National Transportation Safety Board arrived at the scene of the disaster and began an investigation. A report was made seven months later, which found that mechanical malfunction was not at fault for the disaster and neither was the train engineer. Rather it concluded that the accident was likely caused by driver error. Henry Lowe was not intoxicated and did not have a history of hearing or eyesight problems, so the most likely conclusion is that he was distracted at the time of the collision. The NTSB recommended that a signal system be added to the crossing.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nOver 1,400 people attended the funeral of Mr. Henry Lowe and his grandchildren that were killed in the crash. The funeral was held in Carlyle High School gymnasium. The funeral procession to the three different cemeteries was over 200 cars long. Citizens of the Beckemeyer petitioned the Illinois Commerce Commission to install lights at the crossing after the disaster.\n\n\n== References =="

"Uljay_al-Yusufi| 1373 deaths| Atabegs| Mamluk emirs| ","Uljay al-Yusufi, also known as Iljay (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u064a \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0633\u0641\u064a, romanized: Ulj\u0101y al-Y\u016bsuf\u012b; d. 8 Muharram 775 AH  / 1 July 1373 CE), was a senior Mamluk amir in the late eighth century AH/fourteenth century CE. It was during the reign of Bahri Sultan al-Ashraf Sha'ban that he briefly held the highest military office of commander in chief of the army (atabak al-'asakir) and was administrator of the Complex of al-Mansur Qalawun which included the famous hospital (bimaristan).\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nLittle is known about Uljay al-Yusufi's early life and career. Although he was promoted to the highest rank of amirs (amir mi'a, muqaddam alf) in 759/1358 during the second reign of al-Nasir Hasan, it was only after his marriage into the royal family that his power increased. Ibn Taghribirdi notes that he was simply a prominent Mamluk emir, until his marriage to the mother of the reigning sultan, Khawand Baraka. Thereafter, he quickly became more influential and was promoted to the position of commander of the army (atabak al-'asakir) in early 774 AH/ 1372 CE, and put in charge of the bimaristan at the same time.However, his fortune did not last and his influence ended as quickly as it began. It was only a short time after his wife died later in the same year (Dhu al-Qadah 774), and was buried in the madrasah that his relationship with his son-in-law, al-Malik al-Ashraf, began to rapidly fall apart.\nDuring the first days of the following year (6 Muharram 775AH/ 27 June 1373CE) Uljay had a bitter disagreement with the sultan, al-Malik al-Ashraf, over the inheritance of Khawand Baraka. This disagreement soon grew into a violent confrontation between the troops of the sultan and the mamluks of Uljay. In the ensuing battles, Uljay's troops were defeated, and he had to withdraw. The Sultan reportedly offered Uljay the position of governor in the Syrian province of Hama, which Uljay was not ready accept, unless he was allowed to keep all his property, as well as his troops. The sultan was not ready to grant this concession and sent his troops to pursue Uljay, who drowned in the Nile while attempting to flee.According to the chronicler Ibn Taghribirdi, the sultan felt regret at the news of Uljay's death and ordered divers to retrieve the corpse of his opponent. al-Malik al-Ashraf then arranged for Uljay to be buried with honours in his mosque-madrasah (see below).\n\n\n== Public works ==\nUljay commissioned the construction of the Madrasa of Uljay al-Yusufi complex in the district of Al-Darb al-Ahmar in the year 774 AH/ 1373 CE. The mosque is of the cruciform type with four iwans, similar to the mosque-madrasahs of Sultan Hassan, or Sarghatmish. The most remarkable feature of the building is its ribbed dome.\n\n\n== References =="

It follows a young man who apparently dies in a suspicious house fire after saving his girlfriend, Melody; a year later, at the new mall built over the site of the burned-out house, thefts and murders begin to occur as a mysterious figure secretly prowls around the shopping center and takes a keen interest in watching over and protecting Melody.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn an unlit store, a shadowy figure steals clothes and a crossbow. Melody and her friend Susie get jobs at the new mall, just before its scheduled grand opening. The shadowy Eric, his face half scarred, excitedly sees Melody, his former girlfriend, from hidden vantage points around the mall, and leaves flowers and gifts for her. He breaks open a mannequin head to fashion a half-mask. When a mall maintenance worker spots Eric in the ventilation ducts, Eric kills him by forcing his head into a running fan. Eric attacks anyone who threatens Melody; he kills a guard, who spies on women in the dressing room via mall security video, by crushing him into an electrical panel using a forklift. A masked mugger attacks Melody in the parking lot, but Eric shoots him with the crossbow. Later the mugger is revealed to be the mall pianist; Eric kills him on the toilet with a poisonous snake.  The mall owner's son, Justin, harasses Melody's friend Susie; Eric kills him with a lasso pulled into the mall escalator. Reporter Peter Baldwin becomes interested in Melody, investigates the suspicious fire, and with Melody, Susie and pal Buzz, tries to learn if Eric is still alive. A year earlier, Eric Matthews' house was destroyed in a suspicious fire which apparently trapped and killed him, just after he saved his girlfriend Melody.  Now, a year later, in the mall built over the site of his home, Eric plants a time-delay bomb beneath the mall, timed to coincide with the mall's grand opening.\nMall guard Christopher Volker attacks Melody and Peter at gunpoint as they talk, in a car, about the fire; he boasts that he is the arsonist. As they escape and Volker chases them with his car, Eric leaps onto the roof, distracting him and causing a crash. Later, Volker attacks Melody again, knocking her unconscious. Eric fights him, then kills him using the automatic box crusher, and carries Melody to his lair.\nBuzz tricks a guard away from the video surveillance booth so he and Susie can search for Melody. Melody awakens, and talks with Eric. She is glad he is alive, but confesses she does not love him anymore; he angrily declares that he has planted the bomb, so she will die and be with him forever anyway.\nAs Peter searches for Melody in the tunnels, Eric deploys the snake to kill him, for being interested in Melody. When Peter retreats, then later finds them anyway, Eric tries to fight and kill him, but Eric is stunned by Melody's shout that she loves Peter. Peter takes the chance to knock Eric out, so the pair escape and are able to warn Buzz and Susie of the bomb. Eric revives and kills those involved in the arson, the coverup, and the construction of the mall: mall owner Harv Posner and the complicit Mayor Karen Wilton. Melody, Peter, Buzz, Susie, and all of the mall patrons escape, as Eric's subterranean bomb explodes, destroying the mall.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot in southern California at Sherman Oaks Galleria, Promenade Mall (now Westfield Promenade) and Valencia Studios, \"

"Joseph_Parker_vs._Hughie_Fury| World Boxing Organization heavyweight championship matches| 2017 in boxing| September 2017 sports events in Europe| September 2017 sports events in the United Kingdom| 2017 in English sport| Boxing in England| Sports competitions in Manchester| 2010s in Manchester| ","Joseph Parker vs. Hughie Fury was a professional boxing match contested between undefeated WBO heavyweight champion Joseph Parker, and the WBO mandatory challenger Hughie Fury. The bout took place on 23 September 2017, at the Manchester Arena in Manchester. Parker won the contest by a majority decision, with two judges scoring it 118\u2013110 and the other 114\u2013114. The fight was considered to build Parker's worldwide profile as well as earning him the most money he has received for a boxing fight to date.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nIn December 2016, David Haye was made mandatory challenger for Parker's world title. However, he chose to fight cruiserweight Tony Bellew in a heavyweight grudge match on pay-per-view. This pushed Hughie Fury to become next in line for a title shot. As speculation grew, confirmation of the Parker versus Fury fight became closer after promoter Frank Warren indicated he would be announcing details of a fight in the coming week. After a deal not taking place between both fighters promoters, the WBO ordered a purse bid to take place at their offices in Puerto Rico the following week, with the winning bidder winning rights to choose the venue and date. Parker's promoters at Duco Events won the purse bid with a winning bid of US$3,000,011, announcing the date settled for 1 April in Auckland, New Zealand.Higgins, from Duco Events, confirmed the bout would take place at the Spark Arena in New Zealand on 6 May. The reason behind the location was due to Parker enjoying fighting in front of his Kiwi fans. Months prior to the fight, Fury's father and trainer, Peter Fury, was denied a visa entry into New Zealand. This was due to his criminal past, dating back to around 1990 when he was incarcerated for ten years for drug-related offenses. Two days later, Peter was granted a special visa from 28 March to 10 May. But after the disappointing pull-out from Fury, Parker fought replacement R\u0103zvan Cojanu. A frustrating fight for Parker, he extended his undefeated professional record to 23\u20130 and retained his WBO world heavyweight title belt after a unanimous decision victory. The win stated Parker would now look to fight overseas, aiming the United Kingdom to fight Fury.With Fury still being the mandatory challenger, a date was organized for the fight to be rescheduled for 23 September in Manchester. A contract was signed by both parties and would take place at Manchester Arena after both fighters were originally due to fight in Auckland in May but Fury pulled out two weeks before the bout citing a back injury as the reason.\n\n\n=== Controversy ===\nSeveral issues occurred prior to the fight being announced. The date of the then proposed fight between Parker and Fury came up for discussion and was pushed forward to 6 May after Fury and his team appeared reluctant to travel to New Zealand for the fight scheduled for April. It saw WBO President Francisco Varcarcel take to social media to give Fury until 25 February to finalize the bout, otherwise, he would lose his position to challenge Parker for the world championship.In late April, the title fight was called off after Fury pulled out claiming an injury less than two weeks out from the event in Auckland. Varcarcel stated the fight was now off and the problem lay within the Fury camp. After announcing the claim it gave Parker the rights to fight whomever he wanted when he wanted as a voluntary defense out of the top 15. R\u0103zvan Cojanu was released as Parker's replacement for the Hughie Fury bout. The result saw the venue downgraded with it shifting from Spark Arena to the Vodafone Events Centre in Manukau which holds around 3000. Cojanu was ranked fourteenth giving him a chance to challenge for the world championship.Five days out from the fight, The British Boxing Board of Control appointed British referee Terry O'Connor, the same official in charge of Fury's last two bouts. Peter Fury had a foul-mouthed exchange with David Higgins at the final press conference in London. It started off with Higgins approaching Fury, who was unhappy with the appointment of British referee O'Connor for the fight. Higgins was then ejected from the press conference by security officials. Overall Higgins' outburst caused a referee change after it began to create noise and headlines.\n\n\n== Fight card ==\n^Note 1 For WBO heavyweight title ^Note 2 For British bantamweight title ^Note 3 For WBO Inter-Continental junior middleweight title \n\n\n== Fight details ==\nFury failed to capture his first world title after he was outworked by Parker. The fight went the 12 round distance, with two judges scoring the fight 118\u2013110 in favour of Parker and the third judge had it 114\u2013114, giving Parker the win via majority decision. Parker showed Fury respect throughout the fight, having to get through Fury's jab in order to land anything. The opening six rounds saw Fury flicking his jab in to thin air, which caused Parker to think twice before going on the attack. Parker started finding his shots in the latter half. Parker finished strong in the last two rounds as Fury started showing signs of fatigue. In the post fight, Parker said, \"

Construction began during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u201305 and their design was influenced by the IJN's experiences during the war. The British development of the battlecruiser the year after Tsukuba was completed made her and her sister ship Ikoma obsolete, as they were slower and more weakly armed than the British, and later German, ships. Despite this, they were reclassified in 1912 as battlecruisers by the IJN.\nBoth ships played a small role in World War I as they unsuccessfully hunted for the German East Asia Squadron in late 1914. They became training ships later in the war. Tsukuba was destroyed in an accidental magazine explosion in 1917 and subsequently scrapped. Her sister was disarmed in 1922 in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and broken up for scrap in 1924.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nAbout a month after the Russo-Japanese War began in February 1904, the Japanese Diet authorized a temporary special budget of \u00a548,465,631 that would last until the end of the war. It included the 1904 War Naval Supplementary Program which authorized construction of two battleships and four armored cruisers, among other ships. Two of the latter became the Tsukuba-class cruisers which were ordered on 23 June.Based on the experience at the Battle of the Yellow Sea in August 1904 where the Russians opened fire at ranges well beyond what had been anticipated before the war, the IJN decided to arm the ships with 12-inch (305 mm) guns, which outranged the smaller guns used by the existing Japanese armored cruisers. The increase in armament was also justified by a change in the IJN's doctrine for these ships in which they were now intended to participate in the line of battle and overpower the enemy's screening armored cruisers. The Tsukubas were \"

Most First Period houses were built in their first stage as a chimney section and a two-story section to one side, with one room on each floor, and were later extended with additional rooms on the other side of the chimney, giving colonial rooms their characteristic five bay appearance.  Because this one was never extended in this way, it exhibits a three bay front, with a door in the right-side bay, in front of the chimney.  A rear leanto section was added later in the 18th century, and the side ell was added in the 19th century.

The lists won three and four mandates, respectively, and P\u00e9k was not included in his party's assembly delegation on either occasion. (From 2000 to 2011, Serbian parliamentary mandates were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates, and it was common practice for mandates to be awarded out of numerical order. P\u00e9k could have been awarded a mandate on both occasions despite his relatively low list position, though in fact he was not.)P\u00e9k also appeared in the third position on the Hungarian Coalition's list in Senta for the 2008 Serbian local elections, which were held concurrently with the parliamentary election. The list won a plurality victory with twelve out of twenty-nine mandates, and P\u00e9k was awarded a seat in the municipal assembly. When the assembly convened on 7 August 2008, he was chosen as the municipality's mayor.

The Serbian Progressive Party (Srpska napredna stranka, SNS) and its allies won the election and formed a coalition government with the Socialist Party of Serbia (Socijalisti\u010dka partija Srbije, SPS); the VMSZ served in opposition in the parliament that followed. P\u00e9k became a member of Serbia's delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (PABSEC) during the 2012\u201314 term, succeeding fellow party member Elvira Kov\u00e1cs.P\u00e9k again received the fifth position on the VMSZ's list in the 2014 election and was re-elected when the list won six mandates. He was promoted to the fourth position on the party's list for the 2016 election was returned for a third term even as the list fell to four mandates. He continued to serve in Serbia's delegation to PABSEC during these parliaments and was at one time a deputy chair of that organization's culture, education, and social affairs committee.

Some sources place construction date as early as 1674, however, other believe it could have been built in the late XVI for the Calvinists and given to the Catholics later. However, the Catholics reject this hypothesis. According to the documents, the church was consecrated on June 17, 1674, in the name of Saint Peter and St Paul.In 1827 the church was rebuilt by order of Count Ludwik Micha\u0142 Pac. The architect Enrico Marconi reconstructed it in Neo Gothic style that was spreading in England in the second part of the XVIII century. Some researchers presume that Marconi rebuilt the church completely and the building opened in 1827 should be considered a new one.\nIn 1924-25 another restoration was made but it didn\u2019t change the church\u2019s exterior.\nIn 1960 the church was closed by order of the Soviet authorities, a grocery shop was opened in the building. In 1989 it was returned to the Catholic church, restored and reopened in 1990.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe church is a historical monument of Neo Gothic style, though some art historians describe it as eclectic.\nThe single nave is topped by a low pentagon-shaped apse. Two symmetrical side chapels are connected to the side walls of the main volume. A small sacristy is located to the north part of the apse. At the south-west side of the church there is a three-tire bell tower. On both sides of the main entrance sculptures of St Paul and St Peter are standing in the niches. The facades are reveted with Rubble masonry.\n\n\n== References =="

They were the first Youth Olympic Games held outside of Eurasia, and the first Summer Games held outside of Asia and the first to be held in the Western and Southern hemispheres. It was the second Olympic Games held in South America after the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\n\n== Bidding ==\n\nSix bids were initially submitted for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics. Buenos Aires confirmed their bid in September 2011. On 13 February 2013, the IOC selected Buenos Aires as one of the three Candidate Cities for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games. The other two candidate cities were Glasgow and Medell\u00edn. Guadalajara and Rotterdam failed to become candidates. Pozna\u0144 withdrew their bid before the candidate cities were selected.The host city election vote was held at an IOC Session in Lausanne. The results were as follows:\n\n\n== Development and preparation ==\n\n\n=== Organisation ===\nIn October 2013, International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach appointed Namibian sprinter and four-time Olympic silver medalist Frank Fredericks as Chairman of the Coordination Commission for the 3rd Summer Youth Olympic Games \u2014 Buenos Aires 2018. Fredericks was \nheading the six-person IOC Coordination Commission made up of several Olympians including Danka Bartekova, the youngest IOC Member and Young Ambassador from the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in Singapore in 2010. This commission was completed by two other IOC members, China's Li Lingwei, winner of three World Badminton Championships, and Barry Maister, a member of New Zealand's hockey team that won the Olympic gold medals at 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal; and Adham Sharara, Canadian President of the International Table Tennis Federation, and Henry Nu\u00f1ez, head of the National Olympic Committee of Costa Rica. Working along with them there was the Buenos Aires Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee (BAYOGOC), that includes member of the Argentine Olympic Committee (AOC), the local government and the national government, and which CEO was Leandro Larrosa. The local organising committee involves young people in all levels of the organization; including an 'Athlete Commission' and a newly established 'Youth Commission' \u2013 a group of young consultants chosen by the AOC from local schools and universities \u2013 and the employees within BAYOGOC from junior to director level. The first Coordination Commission meeting took place in Buenos Aires on 27\u201328 September 2014.\n\nDuring June 2015 a small delegation from Nanjing Youth Olympic Games Organizing Committee (NYOGOC) visited Buenos Aires for a series of debriefing workshops and seminars to pass on their expertise focusing on strategic decisions to be made in the early stages such as legacy, the use of the YOG to impact youth and sport, and benefits of the YOG to engage communities. The CEOs of Singapore 2010, Lillehammer 2016 and Innsbruck 2012 also took part of these meetings that were presided over by Frank Fredericks.Football player and Olympic gold medalist Lionel Messi, originally not from Buenos Aires but from Rosario, was named as an ambassador of the 2018 YOG in March 2014, and he delivered a video welcoming message for the young athletes to Buenos Aires during the closing ceremony of the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics. In December 2015, the four-time olympic medalist Luciana Aymar was also named as an ambassador of Buenos Aires 2018. In July 2017, Olympic gold medalist Luis Scola was named ambassador of the 2018 YOG.Joining the Olympic programme for the first time at Buenos Aires 2018 were BMX freestyle, kitesurfing, cross country running, beach handball, sport climbing, karate, breakdancing, and roller sports; and the event programme saw an increased gender balance. FIFA also decided to replace football with futsal at the Buenos Aires Youth Olympics, while other sports such as skateboarding were being considered for the programme. Roller speed skating was added to the Olympic programme on 17 March 2017.Three years before the event, a survey showed that public support had reached 82.3 percent in favour of the Youth Olympic games in Buenos Aires. During the second visit of the International Olympic Committee's Coordination Commission to the city, on 13 and 14 August 2015, Mr. Fredericks highlighted the implementation of 13 of the recommendation of the Agenda 2020 by BAYOGOC.\n\n\n=== Venues ===\n\nThe original plan was based on the bid for the 2004 Summer Olympics, in which a 15 km long Olympic Corridor would have worked instead of a more concentrated Olympic Park. For the Buenos Aires bid for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics the Olympic Corridor was adapted into a Green Corridor, one of the two main sports zones as the primary sites of the Games in Buenos Aires 2018, being the other one Parque Roca, to the south of the city. The Green Corridor and the Olympic Corridor shared River Plate Stadium, Tiro Federal, Gimnasia y Esgrima de Buenos Aires, Parque Tres de Febrero, La Bombonera, La Rural and CeNARD as venues.\nIn order to group the sports in a more compact framework, in September 2014 a new four-clusters concept was revealed, dropping out venues such as La Rural. It was announced then that each cluster will include an area called YOG FEST where sporting experiences, family entertainment and cultural activities will take place. But at the 129th IOC Session, in August 2016, a new venues masterplan was presented, including two new stand-alone venues, adding La Rural once again and replacing Parque Sarmiento with Tecn\u00f3polis.\nThe International Olympic Committee members stayed at the Sheraton Hotel, located in the district of Retiro and close to Retiro railway station, one of the most important transportation hubs in Buenos Aires.\nAfter numerous changes, in February 2018, the definitive venues plan was presented.The Opening Ceremony was held at the Obelisco de Buenos Aires.\n\n\n==== A. Green Park ====\n\nAdjacent to downtown Buenos Aires and stretching three kilometres along the scenic banks of the River Plate, this area was distinguished by swathes of parks. It included the barrios of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Palermo. The Palermo Woods, a highly popular retreat for porte\u00f1os and visitors alike, was the triathlon and cycling venue.\nVenues located in N\u00fa\u00f1ez can be reached by Belgrano Norte Line (at Ciudad Universitaria railway station) or by nearby Mitre Line (at N\u00fa\u00f1ez Station) or Buenos Aires underground Line D (at Congreso de Tucum\u00e1n Station). Venues located in Palermo can be reached by Mitre Line (Tres de Febrero and Lisandro de la Torre station).\n\n\n==== B. Olympic Park ====\n\nLocated to the South of Buenos Aires, Roca Park is a vast area of 200 hectares in the district of Villa Soldati, a neighborhood that has been targeted by the local Government in need of urban development. One of the greenest areas in the metropolis, it is adjacent to the City Park and the Buenos Aires Automotive Racetrack. The Park, inaugurated in the 1980s, has many sports venues and recreational facilities, including the iconic Roca Park Athletics Stadium and the Roca Park Tennis Stadium. This area was also the site of the Youth Olympic Village (YOV), from where 65 percent of the athletes were able to walk to their competition venues, and after the event it will become the new location for the CeNARD.\nThe Parque Polideportivo Roca was fully renovated before the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in order to be used as main Olympic Park. Six pavilions were built: Asia Pavilion (judo and wrestling), Africa Pavilion (fencing and modern pentathlon), Europe Pavilion (karate and weightlifting), Oceania Pavilion (boxing and taekwondo), America Pavilion (gymnastics) and natatorium. The complex also includes hockey and athletics field.\nOlympic Park can be reached by Premetro tram at Cecilia Grierson station, or by the southern Metrobus line.\n\n\n==== C. Urban Park ====\nLocated to the east of the city, this cluster occupies a significant portion of the R\u00edo de la Plata riverbank and includes the old Puerto Madero docks as venue for water sports. Rowing competitions were held over 500 metres rather than the usual 2,000 metres.This area can be reached by Buenos Aires Underground lines A, B, D and E.\n\n\n==== D. Techno Park ====\n\nLocated west of the city and next to the General Paz Avenue which marks the limit of Buenos Aires city, the 50 hectares science, technology, industry and art mega exhibition Tecn\u00f3polis was inaugurated in 2011 and was the venue for four sports competitions.

"Leipzig_Prison| Defunct prisons in Germany| Execution sites| Buildings and structures in Leipzig| ","Leipzig Prison (Strafvollzugseinrichtung Leipzig, later Justizvollzugsanstalt Leipzig) was a prison in Leipzig, Germany. Built together with an adjacent court building in 1906, it was used as a prison until 2003. During East German rule, a secret part of the prison was used as the central execution site of East Germany. In 1981, Werner Teske was the final person executed here. The prison was used until 2003, the site is now used as an extension of the nearby court building, with the execution site remaining as a memorial site.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe prison together with the Royal Saxonian State Court building (which now houses the Amtsgericht Leipzig) were completed in 1906. Its main entrance was on Alfred-K\u00e4stner-Stra\u00dfe, which was in the middle of a residential area in the S\u00fcdvorstadt neighbourhood of Leipzig. It was used as a prison until 2002.\n\n\n=== East German execution site ===\n\nFrom 1960, all executions in East Germany took place in the Strafvollzugseinrichtung Leipzig, as the prison was called in East Germany. A separate entrance (Arndtstra\u00dfe 48) led to the secret execution site. A total of 64 people were executed here. At first, the execution method was a guillotine, but problems with failed executions led to the adoption of the Nahschuss ins Hinterhaupt (close-range shot into the back of the head) as the execution method from 1968. The executions were secret and hidden from both the people living nearby and from the inmates of the prison. Executed people included ordinary criminals, Nazi war criminals and former Stasi officials. They were given falsified death certificates, cremated and interred anonymously at Leipzig S\u00fcdfriedhof cemetery. The last person executed here was Werner Teske, who was shot on 26 June 1981.Since 2008, a memorial plaque (commissioned by the Leipzig city council and designed by Gerd Nawroth) at the Arndstra\u00dfe entrance commemorates the execution site. The site can be visited only twice per year: during Long Night of Museums and during Tag des offenen Denkmals, organised by the Runde Ecke Stasi museum association.\n\n\n== Redevelopment ==\n\nMost of the prison was demolished in 2003. However, the historic fa\u00e7ades and the execution site were preserved. In 2017, work was started to turn the former prison site into an extension of the nearby court building, starting with offices for public prosecutors.\n\n\n== Notable inmates executed at Leipzig Prison ==\nHorst Fischer: Participated the selections at Auschwitz concentration camp and was the main camp doctor in the infirmary of the Monowitz concentration camp; executed in 1966.

"Polymeric_immunoglobulin_receptor| Genes on human chromosome 1| Fc receptors| ","Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) is a transmembrane protein that in humans is encoded by the PIGR gene. It is an Fc receptor which facilitates the transcytosis of the soluble polymeric isoforms of immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin M (pIg) and immune complexes. pIgRs are mainly located on the epithelial lining of mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract. The composition of the receptor is complex, including 6 immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular domain. pIgR expression is under the strong regulation of cytokines, hormones, and pathogenic stimuli.\n\n\n== Structure ==\npIgR is produced among others by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and bronchial epithelial cells. pIgR belongs to the family of type I transmembrane proteins. The extracellular portion of the protein contains 6 domains: 5 evolutionary conserved immunoglobulin-like domains, and 1 non-homologous domain, which is involved in proteolytic cleavage of pIg-pIgR complex from the apical side of the IECs. The quite long intracellular domain of the receptor, along with the transmembrane region, is responsible for the transduction of highly conserved signals. During transcytosis, an essential part of pIgR, the secretory component, is attached to the ligand and later cleaved with the ligand to form fully functioning secreted IgA.\n\n\n== History ==\nPer Brandtzaeg showed that secretory component acts as a plasma membrane receptor on epithelial cells for polymeric immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin M. This was paradoxical, as secretory component is a soluble protein, whereas plasma membrane receptors are transmembrane proteins. Numerous models were proposed for how secretory component might work as a receptor, though none of these models resolved this paradox. Keith Mostov and colleagues found that secretory component was a proteolytic fragment of a transmembrane precursor, the pIgR, which led them to propose the currently accepted model\n\n\n== Function ==\nPolymeric immunoglobulin receptor is responsible for transcytosis of soluble dimeric IgA, pentameric IgM, and immune complexes from the basolateral to the apical mucosal epithelial cell surface. pIgR has a strong specificity to polymeric immunoglobulins and is not responsive to monomeric immunoglobulin.  The ligand\u2019s J-chain is responsible for the binding of pIgR to its ligand.\n\n\n=== Transcytosis ===\n\nThe process of transporting polymeric immunoglobulins from the basolateral to apical side, known as transcytosis, is composed of several distinct steps. Transcytosis is initiated by either the binding of dimeric IgA to the receptor or the phosphorylation of Ser-664 residue of the receptor. The internalization of both free and IgA-bound pIgR is mediated by clathrin coating. The internalized receptor is transported to basolateral early endosomes. The following step of transporting the pIgR across the cell (through tubulo-vesicular compartments to apical recycling endosome) is dependent on microtubules. When pIgR reaches the apical membrane, proteolytic cleavage generates either a free secretory component of SC-IgA complex , which is released to the apical lumen. Cleavage occurs at the junction of the transmembrane region of the receptor and domain 5.\n\n\n=== Elimination of Immune Complexes ===\npIgRs are capable of capturing IgA bound to an antigen (Immune complexes (ICs)) with identical affinity as IgA and transport them to apical side. ICs result from the capture of an antigen by an antibody. IgA ICs are formed within the mucous membranes in response to foreign invasion. The accumulation of ICs on the basolateral side of mucous layers can have detrimental effects. Transcytosis of IgA ICs from the formation sites represents an important mechanism of eliminating circulating antigens and minimizing their negative effects.\n\n\n== Regulation ==\n\n\n=== Cytokinetic Regulation ===\nThe expression of pIgR is critically regulated by the pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-4, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3. The transcriptional regulation by different cytokines proceeds through similar pathways, involving the NF-kB feedback loop. Interaction of IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 with their receptors ultimately lead to transcriptional activation of PIGR gene due to nuclear translocation of NF-kB. NF-kB interacts with intron 1 of the PIGR gene to start pIgR mRNA synthesis.Besides NF-kB pathway, the transcriptional induction also proceeds in response to IFN-\u03b3, upregulating the expression of pIgR.Additionally, instead of the usual antagonistic behavior, IL-4 acts synergistically with IFN-\u03b3 to induce pIgR transcription. Their combination exhibits an upregulating effect in PIGR expression because of the presence of STAT6 enhancer, the main downstream effector of IL-4, binding site in PIGR's intron 1.\n\n\n=== Hormonal Regulation ===\nThe level of pIgRs in the mucosal reproductive tract is highly dependent on the activity of sex hormones and correlates with estrous cycle phases. The peaks of pIgR expression at proestrus and estrus phases are due to the dominant activity of estrogen, which acts as a pIgR agonist. The low levels of pIgR during the diestrus are linked to the downregulating activity of progesterone, which peaks during this phase and is able to reverse the activity of estrogen. Androgens are the agonists of pIgR expression in both male and female reproductive tissues.5\u2019-flanking region of the Pigr gene contains a response element to glucocorticoids. This class of hormones increases the steady mRNA expression levels of pIgR of intestinal cells.Prolactin elevates the levels of IRF-1 via Jak-STAT pathway. IRF-1 is known to be a direct agonist of pIgR expression. Considering this linkage, prolactin is believed to exhibit indirect upregulation of pIgR levels during pregnancy and lactation.\n\n\n=== Pathogenic Stimulation ===\nIECs express a variety of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), activation of which ultimately leads to the pIgR upregulation during the infection. The most prominent modulators of pIgR regulation consist of TLR4 and TLR3, which recognize bacterial lipopolysaccharide and viral dsRNA respectively. TLR4, like the majority of TLRs, transduce the signal though MyD88 adaptor and execute the function via NF-kB, which stimulates the expression of pIgR by binding to intron 1 of the gene. TLR3, on the other hand, involves the regulation by the means of IRF-1, which is able to promote the transcription of PIGR gene by binding to exon 1.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPolymeric+Immunoglobulin+Receptor at the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)\n\nThis article incorporates text from the United States National Library of Medicine, which is in the public domain."

The small, solid, elevated shell has an ovate-conic shape. It is white, with a series of about 10 rufous spots near the suture. The five whorls form a conical spire. They are ventricose, with delicate, highly elevated spiral rib-striae,- of which there are about 5 on the upper and 10 on the last whorl. The surface of the ribs is slightly tuberculous, and the last one overhangs the succeeding whorl so as to form a broad deep channel at the suture. The interspaces have about the same width as the ribs, and are beautifully barred with close-set laminae. The base of the shell isconvex, with a small deep scalariform  umbilicus, sculptured like the spire. The aperture is obliquely semicircular. The outer lip is crenulated by the ribs, and conspicuously sulcate within. The columella is sharp, oblique, armed with a fully developed sharp tooth at the base, succeeded by a deep basal notch.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis marine species occurs off Japan, the Philippines, New Caledonia and Fiji\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTo Encyclopedia of Life\nTo World Register of Marine Species\n\"

The term comes from the Kanuri word for pagan; the Kanuri people are predominantly Muslim.\nSince the eleventh century Muslim Bantus, such as the Fulani had begun migrating to Cameroon, where they had attempted to convert the pre-existing peoples.

"2018_Google_data_breach| Google| Data breaches| 2018 in computing| ","The 2018 Google data breach was a major data privacy scandal in which the Google+ API exposed the private data of over five million users.Google+ managers first noticed harvesting of personal data in March 2018, during a review following the Facebook\u2013Cambridge Analytica data scandal. The bug, although it was fixed immediately, exposed the private data of approximately 500,000 Google+ users to the public. Google did not reveal the leak to the network's users. In November 2018, another data breach occurred following an update to the Google+ API. Although Google found no evidence of failure, approximately 52.5 million personal profiles were potentially exposed. In August 2019, Google declared a shutdown of Google+ due to low use and technological challenges.\n\n\n== Overview of Google+ ==\nGoogle+ was launched in June 2011 as an invite-only social network, but was opened for public access later in the year. It was managed by Vic Gundotra.Similar to Facebook, Google+ also included key features Circles, Hangouts and Sparks.\n\nCircles let users personalize their social groups by sorting friends into different categories. Once allowed into a Circle, users could regulate information in their individual spaces.\nHangouts included video chatting and instant messaging between users.\nSparks allowed Google to track users' past searches to find news and content related to their interests.Google+ was linked to other Google services, such as YouTube, Google Drive and Gmail, giving it access to roughly 2 billion user accounts. However, less than 400 million consumers actively used Google+, with 90% of those users using it for less than five seconds.\n\n\n== The breaches ==\nIn March 2018, Google developers found a data breach within the Google+ People API in which external apps acquired access to Profile fields that were not marked as public. 500,000 Google+ accounts were included in the breach, which allowed 438 external apps unauthorized access to private users' names, emails, addresses, occupations, genders and ages. This information was available between 2015 and 2018. Google found no evidence of any user's personal information being misused, nor that any third-party app developers were aware of the leak.\nIn November 2018, a software update created another data breach within the Google+ API. The bug impacted 52.5 million users, where, similarly to the March breach, unauthorized apps were able to access Google+ profiles, including users' names, email addresses, occupations and ages. Apps could not access financial information, national identification, numbers, or passwords. Blog posts, messages and phone numbers also remained inaccessible if marked as private. Unlike the previous breach, access was only available for six days before Google+ learned of the breach. Once more, Google+ found no evidence data being misused by third-party developers.\n\n\n== Responses ==\nIn October 2018, the Wall Street Journal published an article outlining the initial breach and Google's decision to not disclose it to users. At the time, there was no federal law that required Google to inform their consumers of data breaches. Google+ originally did not disclose the breach out of fears of being compared to Facebook's recent data leak and subsequent loss of consumer confidence. In response to the Wall Street Journal article, Google announced the shutdown of Google+ in August 2019. After the second data leak, the date was moved to April 2019. In response to the data breach, enterprise consumers were notified of the bug's impact and given instructions on how to save, download and delete their data prior to the Google+ shut down. Google's Privacy and Data Protection Office found no misuse of user data.\nPrior to the Google+ shutdown, Google set a 10-month period in which users could download and migrate their data. After the 10-month period, user content was deleted. On 4 February 2019, consumers were no longer able to create new Google+ profiles. Google shut down Google+ APIs on 7 March 2019 to ensure that developers did not continue to rely on the APIs prior to the Google+ shutdown.Google is the principal entity of its parent company, Alphabet Inc. After the data breach, Alphabet Inc. share prices fell by 1% to $1,157.06 on 9 October 2018 after an earlier drop of $1,135.40 that morning, the lowest price since 5 July 2018. After the publication of The Wall Street Journal article, share prices dropped as low as 2.1% in two days on 10 October 2018. Share prices steadily increased from this point and met the 8 October 2018 share price on 5 February 2019.Google planned to rebuild Google+ as a corporate enterprise network. Google Play will now assess which apps can ask for permission to access the user's SMS data. Only the default app for telephone distribution is able to make requests. Prior to the data breaches, apps were able to request access to all of a consumer's data simultaneously. Now, each app must request permission for each aspect of a consumer's profile.\n\n\n== References =="

"Super_Slim_Me| English-language films| BBC television documentaries| Documentary films about obesity| Body image in popular culture| ","Super Slim Me is a TV documentary presented by British writer and television presenter, Dawn O'Porter. It was broadcast in the UK by BBC Three on 25 February 2007. Porter was on a mission to see what it takes to shrink her UK size 12 figure to the much-touted super skinny Hollywood zero.\nSurviving on a diet of just 500 calories a day Porter hunted down the stylists, designers and agencies who are responsible for making skinniness not only appear possible, but the ultimate goal for any dedicated follower of fashion.The title is based on the American film Super Size Me where the author consumes McDonald's daily for a month.\n\n\n== Content ==\n\n\n=== Experiment ===\nOver the course of an eight-week period, O\u2019Porter challenged herself to go on a crash diet in order to drop from the nation\u2019s average, UK Size 12, to the mysterious, yet idolised, US Size 0. This aspired image has been formed by alarmingly skinny celebrities over the past decade, who are influencing the attitudes that predominately teenage girls have about their bodies. The images of skinny celebrities in the media also convey the message that being thin is a form of acceptance. However, it was also through this experimental crash diet that O\u2019Porter showed her audience both the physical and psychological effects of this lifestyle. \nThroughout the eight-week time period, O\u2019Porter\u2019s every move was documented by a BBC film crew as she transformed herself. During this process, O\u2019Porter met with fashion designers, stylists, modeling agencies, as well as medical experts to find out what it would take to drop her dress size to the infamous US Size 0 (UK Size 4). She soon found out that in order for her to succeed, her calorie intake had to decrease from the recommended 2000 calories a day, to a maximum of 500 calories a day\u2014just a fraction of what the body needs to maintain health. \nEven after finishing just Day One of her experiment, O' Porter\u2019s attitude had changed and she experienced strange obsessive behaviours, as well as mood swings, all as a result of her hunger. By the end of her diet, the psychological effects worsened leading to irritability, insomnia, and lack of energy.\n\n\n=== Results ===\nAfter a gruelling eight weeks of sticking to a strict diet of only 500 calories and constantly working out Dawn was both physically and mentally exhausted. With this crash diet she was losing sleep, feeling depressed every day and feeling constantly weak. Her results ended up in a 69 cm waist ratio and a weight of 59 kilos leaving her total weight loss at 17 pounds. This resulted in her dropping two dress sizes. Her BMI before she started the diet was 22. She ended the eight-week diet with a BMI of 19.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Truth About Size Zero\n\n\n== References =="

"Double_minute| Medical genetics| DNA| Oncology| Genetics stubs| ","Double minutes are small fragments of extrachromosomal DNA, which have been observed in a large number of human tumors including breast, lung, ovary, colon, and most notably, neuroblastoma.  They are a manifestation of gene amplification as a result of chromothripsis, during the development of tumors, which give the cells selective advantages for growth and survival.  This selective advantage is as a result of double minutes frequently harboring amplified oncogenes and genes involved in drug resistance.  Double minutes, like actual chromosomes, are composed of chromatin and replicate in the nucleus of the cell during cell division.  Unlike typical chromosomes, they are composed of circular fragments of DNA, up to only a few million base pairs in size and contain no centromere or telomere. Further to this, they often lack key regulatory elements, allowing genes to be constitutively expressed. Recently, some research groups are re-branding double minutes as ecDNA.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMicroDNA\nMicronucleus\nExtrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA)\nExtrachromosomal Circular DNA (eccDNA)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBaskin, F; Rosenberg, RN; Dev, V (June 1981). \"

Keren was attacked by the British during the East African Campaign of the Second World War. A force of Italian regular and colonial troops defended the position against British troops (mostly from Sudan and British India) and Free French forces. The town of Keren, in the colony of Italian East Africa, was of tactical importance to both sides. The road and railway through Keren were the main routes to the colonial capital of Italian Eritrea at Asmara and the Red Sea port of Massawa, which surrendered to the British after the battle.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Eritrea ===\n\nColonised by the Italians in 1885, Italian Eritrea was used as a staging ground for Italian invasions of the Ethiopian Empire in the First and Second Italo-Abyssinian Wars. The second invasion began in 1935 and Ethiopia fell in 1936. Ethiopia, Italian Somaliland and Eritrea were combined to form Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana) part of the Italian Empire. Following the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini ordered his troops to capture the British Somaliland and border towns in the Sudan and Kenya.\n\nEritrea has three climate zones; a coastal region of sandy plain and low scrub running inland for 16\u201332 km (10\u201320 mi) in the east with elevations of up to 500 m (1,650 ft), hot and humid for most of the year, with June, September and October the hottest months. At Massawa the average temperature is 31 \u00b0C (88 \u00b0F) and in summer can reach 49 \u00b0C (120 \u00b0F) in the shade. Most rain falls in the summer monsoon, with occasional showers in the winter.  In the escarpments and valleys, the climate is temperate with only summer monsoon rains, except close to the coast, where there is some winter rain.May is the hottest month. Towards the high plateau, the elevation rises steeply to 1,800 m (6,000 ft), with some peaks 3,000 m (10,000 ft) high and the ground declines to the west. It is cooler, with the monsoon from June to September and light rain in April and May. The temperature is highest during the dry season from November to April and above 2,600 m (8,500 ft), sub-alpine temperatures are found. The high ground continues into northern Ethiopia, where the mountains and ravines make ideal defensive terrain.\n\n\n=== Middle East Command ===\n\nThe British responded by building up a force of more than two divisions in Sudan and three in Kenya by early February 1941. The Sudan-based forces\u2014commanded by Lieutenant-General William Platt and under the command of General Archibald Wavell (Commander-in-Chief British Middle East Command)\u2014had invaded Eritrea through Kassala on 18 January and by 1 February had captured Agordat about 160 km (100 mi) further east.\n\n\n=== Italian Invasion of Sudan ===\n\nAnglo-Egyptian Sudan shared a 1,600 km (1,000 mi) border with the AOI and on 4 July 1940, was invaded by an Italian force of about 6,500 men from Eritrea, which advanced on a railway junction at Kassala and forced the British garrison of 320 men of the SDF and some local police to retire, after inflicting casualties of 43 killed and 114 wounded for ten casualties. The Italians also drove a platoon of No 3 Company, Eastern Arab Corps (EAC) of the SDF, from the small fort at Gallabat, just over the border from Metemma, about 320 km (200 mi) south of Kassala and took the villages of Qays\u0101n, Kurmuk and Dumbode on the Blue Nile. From there the Italians ventured no further into Sudan, owing to lack of fuel. They proceeded to fortify Kassala with anti-tank defences, machine-gun posts and strong-points, later establishing a brigade-strong garrison. The Italians were disappointed to find no strong anti-British sentiment among the native population.\n\n\n== Prelude ==\n\n\n=== Keren ===\n\nKeren was not fortified but it is surrounded on most sides by a jumble of steep granite mountains and sharp ridges which gave the defending forces on the high ground a distinct advantage. Control of the mountains provided the Italian artillery with perfect observation of an attack. The narrow Dongolaas Gorge at 15\u00b045\u203234\u2033N 38\u00b025\u203216.8\u2033E through which the road and railway from Agordat to Keren passed was dominated on the south eastern side by the massif of Mount Zeban and Mount Falestoh on which stood the imposing defences of Fort Dologorodoc at 15\u00b045\u203214.9\u2033N 38\u00b025\u203230.6\u2033E. The other side of the gorge was commanded by the mass of Mount Sanchil with a saddle of secondary summits, Brig's Peak, Hog's Back and Flat Top stretching north-westwards toward Mount Sammana. In front of the Sanchil feature on its south western side was a secondary ridge, feature 1616, which became known as Cameron Ridge, overlooking the Ascidera Valley and the railway line.\n\n\n=== Northern front ===\nThe 5th Indian Infantry Division began to arrive in Sudan in early September 1940 and the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade was placed on the Red Sea coast to protect Port Sudan, the 9th Indian Infantry Brigade south-west of Kassala and the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade (William Slim) were sent to Gedaref with the divisional headquarters, to block an Italian attack on Khartoum from Goz Regeb to Gallabat, on a front of 320 km (200 mi). Gazelle Force (Colonel Frank Messervy) was formed on 16 October, as a mobile unit to raid Italian territory and delay an Italian advance. Late on 30 January, Gazelle Force was ordered to make pursuit of the enemy retreating down the road to Keren.\nAs the British forces approached Keren, Brigadier-General Nicolangelo Carnimeo, commander of the 2nd Eritrean Division and the X Territorial Defence Command, drew in his 5th and 44th Colonial Brigades from positions to the north. 42nd Brigade had reached Keren from Agordat almost intact, and the 2nd Brigade\u2014which had suffered greater casualties there\u2014was reforming. The 11th Regiment of the Savoia Grenadiers and the Alpini battalion of the 10th Savoia Grenadiers had just arrived after a three-day non-stop truck journey from Addis Ababa while the 11th Colonial Brigade was also in place, having previously been called from reserve in Addis Ababa. Meanwhile, the 6th Brigade\u2014having relinquished its responsibilities at Metemma\u2014was also making its way to Keren.\n\n\n== Battle ==\n\n\n=== 5\u20138 February ===\n\nAt 08:00 on 1 February 1941, Gazelle Force was held up in crossing the Baraka River about 60 km (40 mi) from Keren, where the Ponte Mussolini had been blown and the approaches to the river mined. By noon on 2 February, they were across the river and winding up the Ascidera Valley, until brought to a halt at the Dongolaas Gorge, about 6 km (4 mi) from Keren, where the road had been blocked by the Italians, who blew down the overhanging crags, to fill the gorge with boulders and rocks.\nThe 11th Indian Infantry Brigade, (4th Indian Division) arrived on 3 February, reconnoitred the next day and attacked on the left of the gorge on 5 February. The 2nd Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders fought their way to the top of the ridge called feature 1616, in front of Sanchil and on the night of 6/7 February, the 3/14th Punjab Regiment passed through and advanced onto Brig's Peak. The Indians were counter-attacked by elements of the 65th Infantry Division \"

"Macias| Surnames| Spanish-language surnames| ","Macias (or more commonly Mac\u00edas) is a Spanish surname found to varying degrees in Europe and Latin America. Within Spain, its frequency is highest in Extremadura, followed by Andalusia, the Canary Islands and Castile and Le\u00f3n.  In Mexico, there are concentrations in Los Altos de Jalisco, Tamaulipas, and along the Texas-Mexico border.\nThere is no singular theory as to the origin of Mac\u00edas. A long-standing argument over its origin revolves around whether or not it is of a Sephardi origin. Some argue that Mac\u00edas originates from the Spanish version of the Hebraic term for the Messiah, while others hold that Mac\u00edas (pronounced [ma\u02c8\u03b8ias] in some areas in Spain) actually is the Spanish version of the Biblical name, Matias or Matthew. Given that the Sephardim used surnames that were in many cases identical to those of their Gentile neighbors, it can be reasoned that certain Mac\u00edas members were Sephardi without the surname Macias being exclusively Sephardi.\nAccording to John Woodward (with reference to the heraldic coat of arms): \"

"Catholic_Church_in_Nepal| Catholic Church in Nepal| Catholic Church by country| ","The Catholic Church in Nepal is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome. As of 2011 there are over 10,000 Catholics in Nepal, organized into one Catholic jurisdiction known as an apostolic vicariate.Catholicism was first propagated in Nepal during the 18th century, though from 1810 to 1950 no missionaries were allowed in Nepal. Since 1951, missionaries have again been allowed to enter the country, though proselytism has remained illegal, and conversion to Christianity remained illegal until 1990. In 1983 a mission sui iuris covering Nepal was created, and in 1996 it was raised to an Apostolic Prefecture. The 1990 Nepali constitution did not guarantee religious freedom for Christians, but as of May 2006 Nepal has been declared a secular state. The interim constitution, finalized in 2007, guarantees some religious freedom but prohibits people from trying to convert others. On February 10, 2007, Benedict XVI elevated the prefecture of Nepal to the rank of a vicariate and appointed Anthony Francis Sharma as the first vicar and first Nepalese bishop of the Catholic Church.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe history of Catholicism in Nepal begins with its inclusion in the diocese of Funchal, Portugal, and in 1533 as part of the diocese of Goa. From then on until 1983, it was a part of many different Indian dioceses. Apart from a short visit of Jesuit fathers Albert d'Orville and Johann Gruber, who spent the month of January 1662 in Kathmandu, missionaries settled in Nepal proper in 1715, when Capuchin fathers entered the Kathmandu Valley at the invitation of the Malla Kings. Father Anthony Francis Sharma, who headed the Catholic mission and then prefecture since 1983, stated, \"

"Aviation_archaeology| Aviation accidents and incidents| History of aviation| Aviation risks| Industrial archaeology| ","Aviation archaeology is a recognized sub-discipline within archaeology and underwater archaeology as a whole. It is an activity practiced by both enthusiasts and academics in pursuit of finding, documenting, recovering, and preserving sites important in aviation history. For the most part, these sites are aircraft wrecks and crash sites, but also include structures and facilities related to aviation. It is also known in some circles and depending on the perspective of those involved as aircraft archaeology or  aerospace archaeology and has also been described variously as crash hunting, underwater aircraft recovery, wreck chasing, or wreckology.\n\n\n== History of aviation archaeology and current issues ==\n\nThe activity dates to post-World War II Europe when, after the conflict, numerous aircraft wrecks studded the countryside. Many times, memorials to those involved in the crashes were put together by individuals, families, landholders, or communities.\n\nCrash sites vary in size and content; some may have fuselages, engines, and thousands of parts and debris.  Other sites, like in civilian/commercial crashes, the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will have almost all of the aircraft and debris removed; which makes aviation archaeology more challenging. Remains of military aircraft crash sites may also be removed by various aircraft restoration groups, particularly if the aircraft was found largely intact. In general, most recent-day (since the 1980s) aircraft crashes are removed entirely, due to environmental regulations, leaving very little to indicate the existence of a wreck.\nFor example, military crashes in Arizona originate from numerous air bases, past and present. Because of the warm and sunny weather, much of the U.S. Army Air Forces flight training was located in the state, both during and after WWII. Numerous air bases dotted the states \u2013 creating conditions for numerous training accidents.  Old abandoned US Army Air Corp auxiliary fields and those converted to city municipal airports provide archaeological sites to be researched and investigated.\n\nKeeping a record of a crash site, such as photographs, maps, journals, logs, and all terrain and weather recordings are essential, e.g., the Glenwood Springs, Colorado, B-17 crash site or the Tells Peak, CA, B-17 crash site.\n\nThe internet is an ideal media for sharing, recording, educating, and promoting aviation archaeology as a hobby, as well as research projects for local and state aviation historical groups. For identifying aircraft type and manufacturer by part numbers and manufacturing inspection stamps can be analysed.  From detailed GPS data & maps, to researching accident reports information, numerous resources help create a complete picture of the historic event.  Accident reports, such as the official US Air Force Accident Report Form 14 becomes the foundation of archaeology research.  From there, newspaper articles, county clerk records, sheriff & coroner reports, and library records all aid an aviation archaeologist in their research.\n\n\n== Protection laws and regulations ==\n\n\n=== United States ===\nLegal protection of aircraft wreck sites is highly variable. In terms of protection by aircraft ownership, the U.S. Navy retains indefinite ownership of all Naval aircraft, including terrestrial or submerged wreck sites. The U.S. Air Force has no policies regarding disturbance of vintage aircraft wreck sites, unless human remains or weaponry remain unrecovered at the site.\nFor vintage aircraft, including vintage military aircraft, that are usually considered abandoned when wrecked, the wreck site and all associated contents are subject to the protection laws of the land upon which it rests. The language of cultural heritage protection laws are not aviation specific, so all protection laws pertaining to aviation sites are based on interpretation. Most federal and state laws are, however, explicit in describing cultural resources as either \u2018objects, sites, or otherwise, of historic value\u2019 or \u2018military or social history\u2019 and deem the time limit as over fifty years old.\nIf an aircraft wreck is over fifty years old, which includes all aviation wreck sites from WWII, and crashed on what is currently federal lands, the sites are automatically protected under National Park Service Law 36CFR2.1 against disturbance of any kind without a permit. Aviation sites, for example, a vintage hangar on an airport or a wreck site on the path of a proposed highway, are also immediately subject to Section 106 review if they are to be disturbed by a project that either requires a federal permit or uses federal funds. In most cases, the State Historic Preservation Officer will determine whether or not an aviation site is eligible for the register.\nThe National Register deems aviation wreck sites as \u201cany aircraft that has been crashed, ditched, damaged, stranded, or abandoned\u201d. It designates the protection terms for aviation history sites as well, including abandoned airfields or facilities sites, testing or experimental sites, land or water air terminals, or airway beacons and navigational aids.\nState lands protection laws vary widely across the nation but the language describing a historical resource is the same as federal laws. Therefore, aviation properties and aircraft wrecks on State lands can be protected under various environmental, public resource, and historical property laws as outlined per state for the protection of archaeological and historic resources.\nAny archaeological survey, excavation, or activity that disturbs wither wreck or aviation property remains can, in some cases, be permitted on federal and state lands under a permitting process through the regulating entity.\nIf an aircraft wreck, or the remains of any aviation property, is located on private land it is not automatically protected by any federal, state, or local law and any survey or excavation work must be permitted by the land owner.\nUnder the 'Sunken Military Craft Act\u2019 (SMCA) of 2004, it is illegal to disturb, remove, or injure the wreck sites or associated contents of U.S. Naval or any submerged military aircraft.  The act identifies military craft as including any sunken military aircraft or military spacecraft that was owned or operated by a government when it sank, and includes the associated contents. Because of the U.S. Navy's retaining of ownership of all military craft, the act applies to any U.S. Navy aircraft, even if in international or other country's territorial waters. The act also applies to any foreign military craft in U.S. territorial waters. Persons wishing to conduct archaeological or research exploration of any submerged military aircraft can apply to the Naval History and Heritage Command\u2019s Underwater Archaeology Branch for a permit. The U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Coast Guard has similar policies and permitting requirements to the Navy.\nThe SMCA includes penalties associated with any unauthorized disturbances of sunken military craft as a fine and a liability for the reasonable costs incurred in recovery of archaeological or cultural information, storage, restoration, care, maintenance, and conservation.\nAs a part of federal air regulations, NTSB Part 830, protects any aircraft whose accident cause is under investigation. NTSB officials will routinely seize portions of wrecked aircraft for further analysis. Most of the time, after their study is complete, the sequestered debris is returned to the owners' representation \u2013 most often the aircraft's insurance company.  However, examples like the reconstructed wreckage of TWA Flight 800 are held in perpetuity by the NTSB to educate the public and future investigators on the NTSB's role in transportation safety.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe laws in the UK cover the remains of all aircraft which have crashed during military service (land or sea) are protected by the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. This Act defines an offence of tampering with, damage to, moving, or unearthing the aircraft remains. Exceptions apply to those holding licences, which can be issued by the Secretary of State, authorising specific procedures to be performed.\nFor the wreck-chasing hobbyist there is a self-regulating body, the British Aviation Archaeological Council (BAAC), which defines ethical standards of behaviour, coordinates activities and provides a forum for discussion for its member groups. Not all active groups in the UK are members of this organisation.\n\n\n== Types of aviation archaeology sites ==\n\n\n=== Terrestrial sites ===\nAviation history sites on land that can be subject to archaeological survey or excavation can include airports (which can contain hangars, terminal, other facilities, etc.), crash sites, monuments, or even properties associated with important persons or events in aviation history.\nSome examples of potential and current archaeological sites:\n\n\n==== Aircraft crash sites ====\nThe Loon Lake B-23 Dragon crash site in Payette National Forest, Idaho is a remarkably intact example of an aircraft wreck. The crew survived and was rescued, and some avionics removed from the site, and it currently is the subject of a teaching aviation archaeology field school in various years.\n\n\n==== Abandoned airfields ====\n\nAbandoned airfields can yield much information of historic information about aviation and related industries.  From civilian airfields to military airfields, aviation archaeologists can find, uncover, and recover a variety of artifacts, just to name a few: aircraft parts with serial numbers, equipment parts, asphalt or runway material, variety of contamination, structures and foundations, businesses and economics, to community and cultural changes. With the closure of a military airbase, the street system and runways become local expansion of city streets and business; one example is the community conversion of Lowry Air Force Base to a local residential, commercial, and educational environment. Other bases, like the Arlington Auxiliary Army Airfield reverted to farming and ranching.\nIn 1990, 1994, and 1998, archaeologists investigated, using airborne remote sensing studies and limited excavation, a vintage hangar of the Huffman Prairie Flying Field Site at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. The investigations were \u201cdesigned to provide information needed for site management by Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park of the National Park Service. The geophysical and remote sensing investigations revealed magnetic, electromagnetic, and ground penetrating radar anomalies and infrared thermal images associated with the hangar structure. The archaeological excavations located an in situ wood post, posthole features, and artifacts which represent archaeological remains of the actual hangar\u201d.  Huffman Prairie Flying Field is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nAnother example is Hamilton Army Airfield in Novato, California. It was in use from 1929 until 1976. It was eventually turned over to the city of Novato for development of housing. The runway is also part of tidal wetland restoration effort currently underway by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, California Coastal Conservancy, and the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission.\n\n\n==== Abandoned missile silos and sites ====\nCalifornia has missile launch sites abandoned by the US Army.  Archaeological research includes these sites throughout the United States.  Exploring and hiking around abandoned silos and sites may constitute trespassing as well as being dangerous.   Permission from current land owners or caretakers is imperative.  Research and formal site investigations adds to the historical record of the Cold War. One such site is the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site.In the Golden Gate National Recreation Area is a decommissioned Cold War era Nike Missile base, Nike Missile Site SF-88. In 1954, it was armed with Nike Ajax missiles. In 1958, it was converted to Nike Hercules nuclear missiles. After it was shut down in 1974, it was turned over to the National Park Service, and it open for to the public regularly. [1]\n\n\n=== Underwater crash sites ===\nA B-29 \"

"ATP6V1B1| Genes on human chromosome 2| Human chromosome 2 gene stubs| ","V-type proton ATPase subunit B, kidney isoform is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ATP6V1B1 gene.This gene encodes a component of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit enzyme that mediates acidification of eukaryotic intracellular organelles. V-ATPase dependent organelle acidification is necessary for such intracellular processes as protein sorting, zymogen activation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and synaptic vesicle proton gradient generation. V-ATPase is composed of a cytosolic V1 domain and a transmembrane V0 domain. The V1 domain consists of three A and three B subunits, two G subunits plus the C, D, E, F, and H subunits. The V1 domain contains the ATP catalytic site. The V0 domain consists of five different subunits: a, c, c', c' ', and d. Additional isoforms of many of the V1 and V0 subunit proteins are encoded by multiple genes or alternatively spliced transcript variants. This encoded protein is one of two V1 domain B subunit isoforms and is found in the kidney. Mutations in this gene cause distal renal tubular acidosis associated with sensorineural deafness.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHuman ATP6V1B1 genome location and ATP6V1B1 gene details page  in the UCSC Genome Browser.\n\n\n== Further reading =="

The club first participated in a European competition in 1955. The first international cup they took part in was the Latin Cup in which they participated as champions of Spain. The competition lasted from 1949 to 1957 and Real Madrid won both tournaments which they entered, the same number as Barcelona and Milan. Since entering the European Cup, in 1955, the club has competed in every UEFA-organized competition, except the Intertoto Cup and Conference League.\nReal Madrid had the most success in the European Cup, winning the trophy for a record thirteen times. Real was the winner of the inaugural edition of the tournament and the only club to win the trophy five times in a row (the first five editions). The club has also won the UEFA Cup twice, in 1985 and 1986, the Super Cup four times, in 2002, 2014, 2016 and 2017, the Intercontinental Cup three times, in 1960, 1998 and 2002, and the FIFA Club World Cup four times, in 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018. Real Madrid, with 26 continental and worldwide trophies, is the most successful team in international football. They have also been involved in European football ever since they became the first Spanish club to enter the European Cup in the 1955\u201356 season, except for the 1977\u201378 and 1996\u201397 seasons.\nIn the tables (H) denotes home ground, (A) denotes away ground, (N) symbolises neutral ground and (P) penalty shoot-out. The first score is always Real Madrid's.\n\n\n== Latin Cup ==\nIn 1949, the football federations of Spain, Italy, France and Portugal launched their own club competition. European clubs could not afford hefty travel costs so the Copa Latina was staged at the end of every season in a single host country. The competition featured two semi-finals, a third place play-off and a final. As La Liga champions in 1955, Real Madrid represented Spain in the competition. They defeated Belenenses 2\u20130 in their semi-final at Parc des Princes in Paris, before beating Reims 2\u20130 in the final at the Parc des Princes. Real Madrid won the 1957 competition at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, defeating Milan in the semi-finals and then Benfica 1\u20130 in the final. After the introduction of the European Cup, the Latin Cup was discontinued and nowadays it is not recognised by UEFA.\n\n\n== European Cup/UEFA Champions League ==\nThe European Cup was inaugurated in 1955, with Real Madrid winning the first five editions. However, after winning the trophy five times in a row in the 1950s, and again in 1966, the club had little success until the end of the 1990s, apart from their runner-up place in 1981. Since then, Real Madrid has won the competition seven times, in 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and established itself as one of the strongest sides in European competitions, when measured in UEFA coefficients.

He won three Champions League trophies in a row in 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\n\n== European/UEFA Cup Winners' Cup ==\nThe Cup Winners' Cup started in 1960, but it took eleven years until Real Madrid participated for the first time. In their first appearance, they lost in the final to Chelsea. In 1975, their second participation, they advanced to the quarter-finals, but were beaten by Red Star Belgrade. They lost their second final in this competition in 1983 when they were beaten by Aberdeen after extra time. They advanced to the quarter-finals in their last participation in 1994, before the tournament was absorbed into the UEFA Cup in 1999. This is the only European tournament to date that Real Madrid has participated in but not won.\n\n\n== UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League ==\nThe Inter-Cities Fairs Cup was established on 18 April 1955, two weeks after the European Cup, to promote trade fairs by playing various cities against each other. From 1958 onwards, the organisers reverted to club participation, but the teams still had to come from cities staging trade fairs. Real Madrid never participated in Fairs Cup before it was subsumed into the UEFA Cup in 1971.The Inter-Cities Fairs Cup is considered to be the forerunner of the UEFA Europa League, but it is not recognized as a UEFA competition. As such, Inter-Cities Fairs Cup wins do not count toward the tally of Europa League wins. This list tallies the Inter\u2013Cities Fairs Cup together with the Europa League tournament. In the UEFA Cup \u2013 Europa League, Real Madrid has won the trophy twice in a row, in 1984\u201385 and in 1985\u201386.\n\n\n== European/UEFA Super Cup ==\nThe European Super Cup was inaugurated in 1973 as a way of determining the best team in Europe, by pitting the holders of the European Champion Clubs' Cup against the winners of the Cup Winners' Cup. It is now a competition between the winner of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. Real Madrid first participated in the 1998 edition, after they won the 1997\u201398 UEFA Champions League. They lost 0\u20131 to Chelsea. Their first trophy came in 2002 after defeating Feyenoord with 3\u20131. Since then, they have won the European Supercup other three times, in 2014, 2016 and 2017.\n\n\n== Intercontinental Cup/FIFA Club World Cup ==\nIn 1960, UEFA and their South-American equivalent, the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL), created the Intercontinental Cup as a way of determining the best team in the world, by pitting the winners of the European Champions' Cup and the South American Copa Libertadores against each other. In 2000, FIFA launched their international club competition called the FIFA Club World Championship, featuring teams from all of its member associations. In the second edition \u2014 renamed the FIFA Club World Cup \u2014 in 2005, FIFA took over the Intercontinental Cup, subsuming it into its own competition.Real Madrid were invited to the championship in January 2000 in Brazil, by virtue of winning the 1998 Intercontinental Cup the previous season. The club finished fourth overall, after losing the third place play-off on penalties to Mexico's Necaxa.  They initially qualified for the 2001 tournament, in their native Spain, but the competition was cancelled before it started.

Permission for the construction of the church was given 1812 by the Lord Commissioners of the Admiralty. The church was designed by the architect Daniel Alexander and built by prisoners from the Napoleonic Wars and finished by those captured during the American war who were held in the prison, and is the only church in England to have been built by prisoners of war.The three stage west tower is surmounted  by pinnacles. Prisoners of war were held in the prison until 1816 and then the church closed. It was reopened and reconsecrated in 1831. In 1868 the chancel was altered and between 1898 and 1901 further alterations and expansion were undertaken under the direction of Edmund Sedding. In 1915 the tower was restored.The east window has stained glass by Mayer of Munich, which was installed in 1910 in memory of the American prisoners who helped to build the church. The graves of many prisoners are in the churchyard. The window was partially funded by a donation of \u00a3250, in 1908, from the National Society United States Daughters of 1812 <https://usdaughters1812.org/> as part of their work commemorating those who died in the War of 1812.

"Women_in_the_United_States_Senate| Female United States senators| Lists of female political office-holders in the United States| Lists of women legislators| Lists of United States senators| ","This article covers the history of women in the United States Senate and various milestones achieved by female senators. It includes a list of all women who have served in the Senate, a list of current female senators, and a list of states represented by women in the Senate. The first female U.S. senator, Rebecca Latimer Felton, represented Georgia for a single day in 1922, and the first woman elected to the Senate, Hattie Caraway, was elected from Arkansas in 1932. Fifty-eight women have served in the upper house of the United States Congress since its establishment in 1789. As of January 20, 2021, there are 24 women (16 Democrats and 8 Republicans) serving.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFor its first 130 years in existence, the Senate's membership was entirely male. Until 1920, few women ran for the Senate. Until the 1990s, very few were elected. This paucity of women was due to many factors, including the lack of women's suffrage in many states until ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, women's limited access to higher education until the mid-1900s, public perceptions of gender roles, and barriers to women's advancement such as sex discrimination.\nThe first woman in the U.S. Senate was Rebecca Latimer Felton, who served representing Georgia for only one day in 1922. Hattie Caraway became the first woman to win election to the Senate, representing Arkansas, in 1932. Margaret Chase Smith was the first woman to serve in both the House and Senate; she first served in the House, and began serving in the Senate in 1949. Margaret Chase Smith won her 1960 race for Senate in the nation's first ever race pitting two women (she and Lucia Cormier) against each other for a Senate seat. Elaine Edwards was the first Catholic woman in the Senate, having been appointed in 1972 by her husband, the Governor of Louisiana, when she was her state's First Lady, and retired from Congress after three months. Muriel Humphrey Brown was the first and only Second Lady to serve in the United States Senate. After her husband, Hubert Humphrey, was defeated in the 1968 presidential election, he won back his old Senate seat, representing Minnesota. Following his unexpected death in office, Brown was appointed by the Governor of Minnesota in 1978 to fill her late husband's Senate seat. She served for less than one year, and did not seek election.\nIn 1978, Nancy Kassebaum became the first woman ever elected to a full term in the Senate, representing Kansas, without her husband having previously served in Congress. Since 1978, there has always been at least one woman in the Senate. The first woman to be elected to the Senate without any family connections was Paula Hawkins (R-FL), elected in 1980. She was also the first and to date only female member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints elected to the United States Senate. There were still few women in the Senate near the end of the 20th century, long after women began to make up a significant portion of the membership of the House. The trend of few women in the Senate began to change in the wake of the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings, and the subsequent election of the 103rd United States Congress in 1992, which was dubbed the \"

"Bremia_(fort)| Roman fortifications in Ceredigion| Roman legionary fortresses in Wales| ","Bremia is the name of the Roman fort in Llanio, West Wales. It is in Llanddewi Brefi community area, south-west of Tregaron, in Ceredigion. The fort was built by the Romans around AD 75 and was in use to AD 120 in Roman Wales. The fort was situated on Sarn Helen, a Roman road leading north from the fort at Dolaucothi. Five inscribed stones have been found within the fort and surrounding military settlement. Two of these have inscriptions which show the garrison to include to a cohort from the Asturias, northern Spain. Amongst the excavations on the site, is the bathhouse. The bathhouse and fort are scheduled monuments, giving them statutory protection from disturbance.\n\n\n== Documentary evidence ==\nThe only documentary evidence for the name Bremia is a list of place names of the known world compiled in around 700 AD, known as the Ravenna Cosmography. This places Bremia between Gobannium (Abergavenny) and Alabum (Llandovery). The fort at Llanio is assumed to be the location referred to.\n\n\n== Archaeological evidence ==\nThe archaeological remains at the site were first noted in the 17th century by Edward Lhuyd, at a site he called 'Cae'r Castell'. Coins, bricks and pottery were all found by him. Details of various excavations were published in 1888, 1961, 1969 and 1972. The dry summers of 1975 and 1976 revealed the extent of the defensive banks and ditches, some street patterns and other details, through cropmarks on aerial photographs. The almost square enclosure, with characteristic rounded corners, measures some 130 metres (430 ft) across, and could have garrisoned some 500 soldiers. Further occupation evidence outside the fort suggests a vicus (settlement) grew up to the south of the fort, which may have housed a further 1,000 people. During the late 1960s and early 1970s a number of excavations were made at the site of the bathhouse, which revealed foundation trenches although the building materials had been removed, and no firm dating evidence was found. A gradiometer geophysical survey of 2005, 75m to the west of the fort, plotted the line of a Roman road running east-west, from the fort, through building plots, with evidence of small smelting or burning sites.\n\n\n== Inscribed stones ==\nDuring excavations, five different inscribed stones have been found. Two of these refer to the cohort of auxiliaries that garrisoned the fort, the other three name different centurians whose men had constructed parts of the fort. The cohort stones read, 'COH II ASTVR ...' (\"

Built from 1839 to 1842 by Bishop Leonidas Polk, it was an active church in the Antebellum South. It was ransacked and later used as a hospital for the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War of 1861-1865. Services resumed after the war, but they were discontinued due to low attendance in 1915. It is now closed, except for an annual pilgrimage.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe church is located six miles southwest of Columbia, Tennessee.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe land belonged to Colonel William Polk. One of his sons, Leonidas Polk, served as the rector of St. John's Episcopal Church, which was based in his own house, Ashwood Hall, from January 1, 1834 to August 9, 1838. Due to poor health, he was assisted in his ministry by James Hervey Otey.In 1839, Leonidas Polk decided to erect the church building. It was built where once stood a tall cherry tree, which was felled and used to make wood structures inside the churches such as the balcony or the reredos. The building was designed in the Gothic Revival architectural style. It was modelled after a church in Devon, England, as well as the Chapel of the Cross in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Built by African slaves owned by Polk and his brothers, it was completed in the summer of 1842. It was consecrated on September 4, 1842.The first permanent pastor, Stephen Patterson, was installed in July 1845. The congregation included both whites and blacks. A new rector, E. H. Cressy, was installed in 1848. The church bell was only placed in the tower as late as 1849. By 1858, James Hildebrand became the new rector. Mary Elizabeth Martin, Gideon Johnson Pillow's wife, and their son, attended services.On March 31, 1862, in the midst of the American Civil War of 1861-1865, Union Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell broke into the church building and ransacked it, breaking the window glasses. By 1864, it was converted into a hospital for the Confederate States Army.

In this very strange and beautiful picture we see the city of New York as it appears when photographed through multiplying prisms, or reflected in the backs of spoons, polished hub caps, spherical and parabolic mirrors. We still recognize houses, people, shop fronts, taxicabs, but recognize them as elements in one of those living geometries which are so characteristic of the visionary experience. The invention of this new cinematographic art seems to presage (thank heaven!) the supersession and early demise of non-representational painting. It used to be said by the non-representationalists that colored photography had reduced the old-fashioned portrait and the old-fashioned landscape to the rank of otiose absurdities. This, of course, is completely untrue. Colored photography merely records and preserves, in an easily reproducible form, the raw materials with which portraitists and landscape painters work. Used as Mr. Thompson has used it, colored cinematography does much more than merely record and preserve the raw materials of non-representational art; it actually turns out the finished product. Looking at NY, NY, I was amazed to see that virtually every pictorial device invented by the old masters of non-representational art and reproduced ad nauseam by the academicians and mannerists of the school, for the last forty years or more, makes its appearance, alive, glowing, intensely significant, in the sequences of Mr. Thompson's film.\n\n\n== External links ==\nN.Y., N.Y. at IMDb\nThe short film N.Y., N.Y.

It was discovered by German astronomer Max Wolf at the Heidelberg-K\u00f6nigstuhl State Observatory on 26 April 1917. The carbonaceous C-type asteroid (Ch) and has a long rotation period of 41.1 hours and is likely elongated in shape. The origin of the asteroid's name remains unknown.\n\n\n== Orbit and classification ==\nLova is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.3\u20133.1 AU once every 4 years and 5 months (1,624 days; semi-major axis of 2.7 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.15 and an inclination of 6\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg Observatory on 3 March 1930, almost 13 years after its official discovery observation.\n\n\n== Naming ==\nThis minor planet was named by the discoverer. Any reference of this name to a person or occurrence is unknown.\n\n\n=== Unknown meaning ===\nAmong the many thousands of named minor planets, Lova is one of 120 asteroids, for which no official naming citation has been published. All of these low-numbered asteroids have numbers between 164 Eva and 1514 Ricouxa and were discovered between 1876 and the 1930s, predominantly by astronomers Auguste Charlois, Johann Palisa, Max Wolf and Karl Reinmuth (also see category).\n\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\nIn the Tholen classification, Lova is a common, dark C-type asteroid with a noisy spectrum (:), while in the Bus\u2013Binzel SMASS classification, it is a hydrated, carbonaceous subtype (Ch).\n\n\n=== Rotation period ===\nIn November 2017, a rotational lightcurve of Lova was obtained from photometric observations by Tom Polakis at the Command Module Observatory (V02) in Arizona. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 41.118\u00b10.011 hours with a brightness variation of 0.28\u00b10.01 magnitude (U=3). While not being a slow rotator, which have periods of 100 or more hours, Lova's period is significantly longer than the vast majority of asteroids, which rotate within 2.2 to 20 hours once around their axis.\nA lower-rated lightcurve by French amateur astronomer Laurent Bernasconi gave a similar period of 41.3\u00b10.2 hours with a higher amplitude of 0.40\u00b10.01 magnitude, indicative of an elongated shape (U=2). The results supersede a period determination with a lower limit of 24 hours and amplitude of at least 0.11 magnitude by Brian Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado from November 1999 (U=2). In 2006, Warner revised his photometric data, though with no notable improvement or change for this asteroid.\n\n\n=== Diameter and albedo ===\nAccording to the surveys carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, and the Japanese Akari satellite, Lova measures (50.692\u00b10.191), (52.47\u00b11.5) and (55.45\u00b10.73) kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of (0.056\u00b10.006), (0.0524\u00b10.003) and (0.048\u00b10.002), respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results from IRAS, that is, a low albedo of 0.0524 and a diameter of 52.47 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.22. Alternative mean-diameter measurements published by the WISE team include (49.742\u00b117.318 km), (50.057\u00b112.98 km), (51.194\u00b10.567 km) and (59.77\u00b119.19 km) with corresponding albedos of (0.0400\u00b10.02), (0.0400\u00b10.0411), (0.0550\u00b10.0072) and (0.03\u00b10.01).Two asteroid occultations, observed on 5 April 2006 and 12 July 2007, gave a best-fit ellipse dimension of (52.0\u2009\u00d7\u200952.0) and (43.3\u2009\u00d7\u200964.3) kilometers, respectively, with the latter being the better rated one. These timed observations are taken when the asteroid passes in front of a distant star.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLightcurve Database Query (LCDB), at www.minorplanet.info\nDictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books\nAsteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR \u2013 Geneva Observatory, Raoul Behrend\nDiscovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (1)-(5000) \u2013 Minor Planet Center\n868 Lova at AstDyS-2, Asteroids\u2014Dynamic Site\nEphemeris \u00b7 Observation prediction \u00b7 Orbital info \u00b7 Proper elements \u00b7 Observational info\n868 Lova at the JPL Small-Body Database"

"Talc_carbonate| Metamorphic rocks| Metamorphic petrology| Igneous rocks| ","Talc carbonates are a suite of rock and mineral compositions found in metamorphosed ultramafic rocks.\nThe term refers to the two most common end-member minerals found within ultramafic rocks which have undergone talc-carbonation or carbonation reactions: talc and the carbonate mineral magnesite.\nTalc carbonate mineral assemblages are controlled by temperature and pressure of metamorphism and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide within metamorphic fluids, as well as by the composition of the host rock.\n\n\n== Compositional controls ==\nIn a general sense, talc carbonate metamorphic assemblages are diagnostic of the magnesium content of the ultramafic protolith. \n\nLower-magnesian ultramafic rocks (12-18% MgO as a rule of thumb) tend to favor talc-chlorite assemblages\nMedium-MgO rocks (15-25% MgO) tend to produce talc-amphibole assemblages.\nHigh-MgO rocks with in excess of 25% MgO tend to form true talc-magnesite metamorphic assemblages.Thus, the MgO content of a metamorphosed ultramafic rock can be estimated by understanding the mineral assemblage of the rock. Magnesium content determines the proportion of talc and/or magnesite and aluminium-calcium-sodium content determines the proportion of amphibole and/or chlorite.\n\n\n== Talc carbonate minerals ==\nSeveral minerals are diagnostic of talc carbonated ultramafic rocks;\n\nTalc\nChlorite, generally magnesian bluish-green\nTremolite-cummingtonite-grunerite amphiboles in greenschist facies rocks\nAnthophyllite-cummingtonite amphibole in weakly carbonated serpentinite at greenschist facies or very rarely, uncarbonated amphibolite facies serpentinites\nMagnesite, and rarely dolomite in association with amphibolitic compositionsAt amphibolite facies, the diopside-in isograd is reached (dependent on carbon dioxide partial pressure) and metamorphic assemblages trend toward talc-pyroxene and eventually toward metamorphic olivine.\n\n\n=== Mineral reactions ===\nSerpentinisation of olivine:\n\nforsterite2Mg2SiO4 + 3H2O \u2192 serpentineMg3Si2O5(OH)4 + bruciteMg(OH)2Or by addition of aqueous silica:\n\n3Mg2SiO4 + 4H2O + SiO2,aq \u2192 2Mg3Si2O5(OH)4Carbonation of serpentine to form talc-magnesite\n\n2Mg3Si2O5(OH)4 + 3CO2 \u2192 Mg3Si4O10(OH)2 + 3MgCO3 + 3H2O\n\n\n== Occurrence ==\nBecause carbon dioxide is such a common component of metamorphic fluids, talc-carbonated ultramafics are relatively common. However, the degree of talc-carbonation is usually somewhere between the two end-member compositions of pure serpentinite and pure talc-carbonate. It is common to see serpentinites which contain talc, amphibole and chloritic minerals in small proportions which infer the presence of carbon dioxide in the metamorphic fluid.\nTalc carbonate is present in many of the ultramafic bodies of the Archaean Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia. Notably, the Widgiemooltha Komatiite shows pure talc-carbonation on the eastern flank of the Widgeimooltha Dome, and almost pure serpentinite metamorphism on the western flank.\n\n\n== Carbonation of other rocks ==\nCarbon dioxide has less severe impacts on mafic, felsic and rocks of other composition, such as carbonate rocks, chemical sediments, etcetera. The exception to this rule is the calc-silicate family of metamorphic rocks, which are also subjected to wide variations in mineral speciation due to the mobility of carbonate during metamorphism.\nFelsic and mafic rocks tend to be less affected by carbon dioxide due to their higher aluminium content. Ultramafic rocks lack aluminium, which allows carbonate to react with magnesium silicates to form talc. In rocks with extremely low aluminium contents, this reaction can progress to create magnesite.\nAdvanced carbonation of felsic and mafic rocks, very rarely, creates fenite, a metasomatic alteration caused particularly by carbonatite intrusions. Fenite alteration is known, but very restricted in distribution, around high-temperature metamorphic talc-carbonates, generally in the form of a sort of aureole around ultramafics. Such examples include biotite-rich zones, amphibolite-calcite-scapolite alteration and other unusual skarn assemblages.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmphibolite\nGranulite\nGreenschist\nKomatiite\nList of rock types\nMetamorphic rock\nSerpentinite\nSoapstone\nUltramafic rocks\n\n\n== References =="

"Superspreading_event| Biological hazards| Epidemics| Epidemiology| Global health| Infectious diseases| Pandemics| Zoonoses| ","A superspreading event (SSEV) is an event in which an infectious disease is spread much more than usual, while an unusually contagious organism infected with a disease is known as a superspreader. In the context of a human-borne illness, a superspreader is an individual who is more likely to infect others, compared with a typical infected person. Such superspreaders are of particular concern in epidemiology.\nSome cases of superspreading conform to the 80/20 rule, where approximately 20% of infected individuals are responsible for 80% of transmissions, although superspreading can still be said to occur when superspreaders account for a higher or lower percentage of transmissions.  In epidemics with such superspreader events, the majority of individuals infect relatively few secondary contacts.SSEVs are shaped by multiple factors including a decline in herd immunity, nosocomial infections, virulence, viral load, misdiagnosis, airflow dynamics, immune suppression, and co-infection with another pathogen.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nAlthough loose definitions of superspreader events exist, some effort has been made at defining what qualifies as a superspreader event (SSEV). Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) define a protocol to identify a superspreader event as follows:\nestimate the effective reproductive number, R, for the disease and population in question;\nconstruct a Poisson distribution with mean R, representing the expected range of Z due to stochasticity without individual variation;\ndefine an SSEV as any infected person who infects more than Z(n) others, where Z(n) is the nth percentile of the Poisson(R) distribution.This protocol defines a 99th-percentile SSEV as a case which causes more infections than would occur in 99% of infectious histories in a homogeneous population.During the SARS-CoV-1 2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak from China, epidemiologists defined a superspreader as an individual with at least eight transmissions of the disease.Superspreaders may or may not show any symptoms of the disease.SSEVs can further be classified into 'societal' and 'isolated' events.In April 2020 Jonathan Kay reported in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic:\nPutting aside hospitals, private residences and old-age homes, almost all of these superspreader events (SSEVs) took place in the context of (1) parties, (2) face-to-face professional networking events and meetings, (3) religious gatherings, (4) sports events, (5) meat-processing facilities, (6) ships at sea, (7) singing groups, and, yes, (8) funerals.\n\n\n== Factors in transmission ==\n\nSuperspreaders have been identified who excrete a higher than normal number of pathogens during the time they are infectious. This causes their contacts to be exposed to higher viral/bacterial loads than would be seen in the contacts of non-superspreaders with the same duration of exposure.\n\n\n=== Basic reproductive number ===\nThe basic reproduction number R0 is the average number of secondary infections caused by a typical infective person in a totally susceptible population. The basic reproductive number is found by multiplying the average number of contacts by the average probability that a susceptible individual will become infected, which is called the shedding potential.R0 = Number of contacts \u00d7 Shedding potential\n\n\n=== Individual reproductive number ===\nThe individual reproductive number represents the number of secondary infections caused by a specific individual during the time that individual is infectious. Some individuals have significantly higher than average individual reproductive numbers and are known as superspreaders. Through contact tracing, epidemiologists have identified superspreaders in measles, tuberculosis, rubella, monkeypox, smallpox, Ebola hemorrhagic fever and SARS.\n\n\n=== Co-infections with other pathogens ===\nStudies have shown that men with HIV who are co-infected with at least one other sexually transmitted disease, such as gonorrhea, hepatitis C, and herpes simplex 2 virus, have a higher HIV shedding rate than men without co-infection. This shedding rate was calculated in men with similar HIV viral loads. Once treatment for the co-infection has been completed, the HIV shedding rate returns to levels comparable to men without co-infection.\n\n\n=== Lack of herd immunity ===\nHerd immunity, or herd effect, refers to the indirect protection that immunized community members provide to non-immunized members in preventing the spread of contagious disease. The greater the number of immunized individuals, the less likely an outbreak can occur because there are fewer susceptible contacts. In epidemiology, herd immunity is known as a dependent happening because it influences transmission over time. As a pathogen that confers immunity to the survivors moves through a susceptible population, the number of susceptible contacts declines. Even if susceptible individuals remain, their contacts are likely to be immunized, preventing any further spread of the infection. The proportion of immune individuals in a population above which a disease may no longer persist is the herd immunity threshold. Its value varies with the virulence of the disease, the efficacy of the vaccine, and the contact parameter for the population. That is not to say that an outbreak can't occur, but it will be limited.\n\n\n== Superspreaders during outbreaks or pandemics ==\n\n\n=== COVID-19 pandemic: 2020\u2013present ===\nThe South Korean spread of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection jumped suddenly starting on 19\u201320 February 2020. On 19 February, the number of confirmed cases increased by 20.

The English press blamed their own fly half Mike Weston for the Calcutta Cup loss; saying his inaccurate tactial kicking 'made Blaikie look like a world-beater'.Playing against Australia in 1968, it was said that he performed 'quietly and efficiently' in a 9\u20133 win for Scotland, and kicked two penalties in a swirling wind.He kicked a 35-yard penalty that helped Scotland on the way to a 6\u20133 win over France in January 1969.Although he was in the losing side in Scotland's match against Wales in February 1969 it was reported that Blaikie came through with his reputation 'untarnished'.His last match for Scotland - against England at Twickenham in March 1969 - was deemed 'disastrous'. Blaikie failed to clear his lines and missed 3 kickable penalties. As a result, it was England that won the match 8\u20133.He was in a Scotland XV select that later toured South Africa that year. It was reported that Blaikie had a great tour, and scored against an Argentine select side.He remained in the Scotland reckoning for a couple of years after this; and was originally selected to face England at Twickenham again in 1971 (when Ian Smith was dropped), but injury prevented further caps.\n\n\n== Family ==\nHis son Paul Blaikie was a golfer based in South Africa; but often played in Scotland's Amateur Championships.\n\n\n== References =="

The term originally referred to the controversial practices and policies of U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy (R-Wisconsin), and has its origins in the period in the United States known as the Second Red Scare, lasting from the late 1940s through the 1950s. It was characterized by heightened political repression and persecution of left-wing individuals, and a campaign spreading fear of alleged communist and socialist influence on American institutions and of espionage by Soviet agents. After the mid-1950s, McCarthyism began to decline, mainly due to Joseph McCarthy's gradual loss of public popularity and credibility after several of his accusations were found to be false, and sustained opposition from the U.S. Supreme Court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren on human rights grounds. The Warren Court made a series of rulings on civil and political rights that overturned several McCarthyist laws and directives, and helped bring an end to McCarthyism.What would become known as the McCarthy era began before McCarthy's rise to national fame. Following the breakdown of the wartime East-West alliance with the Soviet Union, and with many remembering the First Red Scare, President Harry S. Truman signed an executive order in 1947 to screen federal employees for possible association with organizations deemed \"

The original WebMediaBrands was established in 1994, and headquartered in New York. Founded by Alan M. Meckler and Tristan Louis, the company provides business-to-business (B2B) services for creative, business and information technology professionals, including recruitment and event promotion.\nUntil 2014, the company also operated a group of websites aimed towards the B2B market\u2014particularly blogs covering various aspects of the media industry. In August 2014, Mediabistro sold its editorial properties to Prometheus Global Media, a subsidiary of Guggenheim Partners, for $8 million.The company announced it would liquidate itself on December 22, 2015 \n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1994, Alan Meckler, then CEO of Mecklermedia, created MecklerWeb as an addendum to his offerings in print (Virtual Reality World, CDrom World, and Internet World) and conferences (Internet World, Virtual Reality World). In 1995, as advertising-supported publishing emerged as a viable business model on the Web, the Website was relaunched by Tristan Louis under the name iWorld and began to publish content for the nascent Internet industry. As the Internet World conference prospered, iWorld set out on a strategy of acquiring successful Websites that were focused on technology content, such as Webopedia, SearchEngineWatch and WebReference. In 1997, the online division was renamed internet.com, after acquiring rights to the domain name from The Internet Company.\nIn 1998, Mecklermedia Corp. was acquired by Penton Media and the online assets were spun off into a separate company called Internet.com LLC. Internet.com went public on the NASDAQ in the second half of 1999 (trading as INTM). In 1999, internet.com Corp. launched the Search Engine Strategies conference and in 2000, it acquired Earthweb and incorporated it into the JupiterWeb network. In 2002, the company purchased the Jupiter Research business from Jupiter Media Metrix and renamed itself from INT Media to Jupitermedia, with a new stock ticker symbol JUPM.\nIn 2004, the company started acquiring image assets and developed Jupiterimages as a separate stock photography division, which operated two online image libraries, stock.xchng, a library of free-to-use photographs and illustrations, and StockXpert, a low-cost Microstock photography site.\nIn 2005, Jupitermedia sold SearchEngineWatch to Incisive Media. In 2006, Jupitermedia sold its JupiterResearch division to MCG Capital Corporation. In 2007, the company operates as two divisions, JupiterImages and Jupiter Online Media.\nIn 2008, JupiterResearch was acquired by Forrester Research.In October 2008, Jupitermedia announced that they would be selling their online images division, Jupiterimages, to the stock photography agency Getty Images for $96 million in cash. The sale went ahead in February 2009; Jupiterimages (including the sites stock.xchng and StockXpert) is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Getty.Following the sale, JupiterMedia changed its name to WebMediaBrands Inc.  In August 2009, Quinstreet Inc. acquired the Internet.com division of WebMediaBrands for $18 million. Among the sites sold as part of Internet.com were InternetNews.com, Webopedia.com, ServerWatch.com, DatabaseJournal.com, Datamation.com, eSecurityPlanet.com, EnterpriseNetworkingPlanet.com, SmallBusinessComputing.com and Developer.com.\nWebMediaBrands changed its name to Mediabistro on June 13, 2013.\nOn May 29, 2014, Mediabistro announced that it would sell its publishing assets to Prometheus Global Media, a subsidiary of Guggenheim Partners, for $8 million.

Some dispute exists as to where on the 30,000-acre tract the settlement started  Originally, a block house was constructed overlooking an existing Iroquois trail (also known as the Shenandoah Hunting Path and the Old Carolina Road) between the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers. However, settlement lagged, the heirs of the original grantees divided the property, and the tract was not surveyed until 1737\u201338. Prince William County, Virginia, was split from Stafford County in 1731, and by 1742 residents had petitioned the House of Burgesses. The Bristows took the northern portion (and had disputes with their agents), and the Footes the southernmost portion, with the Brents adjacent to the Bristows and the Haywards between the Brents and the Footes.\nBecause of its central location within the new county, Brent Town became Prince William Court House around 1820 (since Dumfries was too far east). The second Prince William courthouse was built on the Foote portion, and the fourth courthouse on the Bristow portion of the original Brent Town Tract, as had been the Broad Run Church around 1752. As a Loyalist who died in England in 1776, Robert Bristow's lands were declared escheated to the state in 1779 (although a son contested the loss of 7,500 acres).\nBrentsville was first platted in 1822 (by seven trustees while that litigation continued). Seventy lots were laid out, and  a court house, clerk's office and jail constructed. It became Prince William County's fourth county seat from 1820 to January 1, 1894.  Parts of the former Bristow portion were auctioned in 1834, with the proceeds called the Literary Fund and to be used for educational purposes. By 1835, Brentsville had two taverns, 3 stores, a nondenominational church and 19 dwelling houses.The town prospered after construction of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, although Manassas Junction became even more important economically, and started campaigning to become the county seat. An Episcopal Church was constructed in 1847 (St. James Church of Dettingen Parish). It became a strategic location in the American Civil War and suffered heavy damage. Union troops deconstructed parts of the courthouse to build other structures.\nTwo buildings were built in 1871: a Union Church (used by the Methodists, Episcopalians and Baptists) and a one-room schoolhouse. The school continued even after the county seat was moved to Manassas in 1893 (and hired an additional teacher in 1908, and a third teacher hired and high school course also being offered in 1821). In 1897, a Baptist congregation succeeded the Episcopal congregation at its church, but the Union Church continued. A Presbyterian congregation was organized in the town in 1915, and built their own building in 1952. Prince William County bought the Union Church and other properties in 1997 to create a Brentsville Historical Area Park.\nThe Brentsville Historic District, Brentsville Courthouse and Jail, Moor Green, and White House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBrentsville, Virginia Website\nBrentsville Courthouse Historic Centre, Prince William Historic Preservation Division\nPrince William County Government"

The number of victims ranges from 1,200 to 7,000, depending on the source.\n\n\n== Uprising in Batak ==\nThe role of Batak in the April Uprising was to take possession of the storehouses in the surrounding villages and to ensure that the insurgents would have provisions, also to block the main ways and keep the Turkish soldiers from receiving supplies. The task of Batak was to manage with the Pomak villages (Chepino and Korovo) should those try to prevent the uprising. Should the chetas in the nearby locations fail in their commands, the rest should have gathered in Batak. \nThe only problem the organization of the uprising had expected was that Batak had to defend itself alone against the Turkish troops, but the risk was taken. \nAfter the April uprising started on 30 April 1876, part of the armed men in Batak, led by the voivode Petar Goranov, attacked the Turks. They succeeded to eliminate part of the Ottoman leaders, but were reported to the authorities and 5,000 Bashi-bazouk were sent, mainly Pomaks (Slavic Muslims), led by Ahmet Aga from Barutin which surrounded the town. At that time the Pomaks were a part of the Ottoman Muslim Millet. After a first battle, the men from Batak decided to negotiate with Ahmet Aga. He promised them the withdrawal of his troops under the condition that Batak disarmed. After the rebels had laid down their weapons, the Bashi-bazouk attacked them and beheaded them.\n\n\n== Massacre ==\nWhile some of the leaders of the Revolutionary committee were surrendering the weapons, some managed to escape the village, but immediately after that all the territory was surrounded and no one else was let out. The Bashi-Bozouk went to the houses and raided them; many were burnt and they shot at everyone and everything. Many of the people decided to hide into the houses of the wealthy or in the church, which had a stronger construction and was going to protect them from the fire. \nOn 2 May, those hidden in the House of Bogdan surrendered, because they were promised by Ahmet Aga to be spared. More than 200 men, women and children were led out, stripped out of their valuables and clothes, in order not to stain them with their blood, and were brutally killed. \nThe Aga asked some of the wealthy men of Batak to go to his camp and lay down all the arms of the villagers. Amongst them was the mayor Trendafil Toshev Kerelov and his son, Petar Trandafilov Kerelov. They had reached an agreement that if the village were disarmed, the Pomaks would leave Batak for good. But instead, the Bulgarians were caught captive \u2013 once the arms were confiscated, all of them were beheaded, burnt alive or impaled. \nThe murder of the leader Trendafil Kerelov was particularly violent and was described by a witness \u2013 his son's wife Bosilka:\n\"

Per post-WWII historiography in North Macedonia he was an ethnic Macedonian.\n\n\n== Life ==\nGlavinov studied in his native Veles by the local Bulgarian national revival activist Yordan Hadzhikonstantinov-Dzhinot. Then he worked here, before moving to Sofia in 1887. There he found employment in a brickworks, but later he went bankrupt, owing to the financial support which he gave to the first Bulgarian theatre troupe. In July 1891 on the initiative of Dimitar Blagoev, several social democratic circles united to form the Bulgarian Socialdemocratic Party. In 1892 Glavinov became acquainted with Dimitar Blagoev's exposition of the Marxist view of history and in 1894 he entered the new Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party. In the same year, under Vasil Glavinov's leadership and in order of Blagoev, the first Social-Democratic group in Ottoman Macedonia was formed.In 1896 Glavinov founded a Macedonian-Adrianople Social Democratic Group, as part of the Bulgarian Workers' Social-Democrat Party. The last idea was probably influenced by the League for the Balkan Confederation, created in 1894 by Balkan socialists, which supported Macedonian autonomy inside a general federation of Southeast Europe. In Sofia Glavinov edited several Socialist papers. He met there one of the leaders of the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) Gotse Delchev and both became a friends. Glavinov and Delchev were feeling the lack of funds, and both decided to steal a money from Bulgarian Posts. Their friend Zlatarev took 28,000 leva from the post-office in Kyustendil and fled over the border into Ottoman Macedonia. He had passed on 25,000 leva to Glavinov and his relative Kiprov, to give it to Delchev. The IMARO didn't receive the money. Glavinov maintained that both had buried the leva near a river which had subsequently flooded the area and carried it away.The first Conference of Macedonian Socialists was held on June 3, 1900, near Krushevo, where the activities of Vasil Glavinov's political group defined the basic aspects of the creation of Macedonian republic as a part of Balkan Socialist Federation.

Dialynas Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. Bertrand belongs to the world's most prominent labour economists in terms of research, which has been awarded the 2004 Elaine Bennett Research Prize and the 2012 Sherwin Rosen Prize for Outstanding Contributions in the Field of Labor Economics.She is a research fellow of the National Bureau of Economic Research, and the IZA Institute of Labor Economics. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nMarianne Bertrand earned a B.A. in economics and a M.Sc. in econometrics from the Free University of Brussels in 1991 and 1992. Thereafter, she did a Ph.D. in economics at Harvard University. After her graduation in 1998, she became an assistant professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs but left for the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business in 2000. There, she was promoted to full professor in 2003, followed by the positions of Fred G. Steingraber/A.T. Kearney Professor of Economics and Chris. P. Dialynas Professor Economics. In addition to her academic position, Bertrand maintains affiliations with the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab, where she is a member of the Board of Directors and currently co-chairs J-PAL's Labor Markets sector, the Russell Sage Foundation, IZA, NBER, and CEPR. At Chicago, she is involved as Faculty Director in the Inclusive Economy Lab of the university's Urban Labs as well as in the Chicago Booth's Rustandy Center for Social Sector Innovation, Booth's social impact hub. She also has performed editorial duties for the American Economic Review, Quarterly Journal of Economics, American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, Economic Journal, and the Journal of the European Economic Association.\n\n\n== Research ==\nMarianne Bertrand's research interests include labour economics, corporate governance and development economics. In most of her research she uses economic experiments, often in collaboration with her frequent co-author Sendhil Mullainathan. According to IDEAS/RePEc, Bertrand ranked in September 2018 157th in terms of research among 54 233 registered economists (i.e., among the top 0.3%) and 5th among 10 406 female economists (among the top 0.05%)\n\n\n=== Research on labour economics, discrimination and gender gaps ===\nOne key area of Bertrand's research is labour economics, in particular racial and gender discrimination. Together with Sendhil Mullainathan, she finds that the introduction of antitakeover legislation, which shield companies somewhat from competition, in the 1980s raised wages  by 1\u20132%, thus suggesting that managers have some discretion in wage setting. In a seminal contribution to research on racial labour market discrimination, Bertrand and Mullainathan manipulate perceived race on fictitious resumes sent in reply to help-wanted ads by using Afro-American- or Caucasian-sounding names and observe that \"

She came to prominence by appearing as a model on a number of album covers, most notably Whipped Cream & Other Delights (1965) by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass.\n\n\n== Early life and modeling ==\nErickson, the oldest of eight children, was raised first in Port Angeles, Washington, before moving with her family to Seattle, Washington, where she graduated from Cleveland High School in 1954. She  started her modeling career at 14 or 15 after winning a contest to model for the Seattle department store Frederick & Nelson. In 1954, she won the Miss Maritime beauty pageant, and in 1955 won Miss Greenwood and competed to be Seafair Queen. She was also Miss Longshoreman.With two fellow Seafair Princesses, future actresses Dorothy Provine and Dyan Cannon, Erickson visited San Francisco, where she found work for Macy's department store, earning $600 weekly at age 19. She left the University of Washington to pursue a modeling career, signing with the Ford Modeling Agency in New York City. Erickson did photo shoots for fashion layouts and for cosmetics companies such as Max Factor, and appeared on 13 or 18 album covers for artists such as the Kingston Trio (Sold Out), Cy Coleman (Piano Witchcraft), Nat King Cole (Wild Is Love), and The Sandpipers (Guantanamera).The modeling led, in early 1960, to Paramount Pictures signing her as a contract player. The studio later traded her to Warner Bros. She was scheduled to appear in the film The Pleasure of His Company, and did have roles in Love in a Goldfish Bowl and Jerry Lewis' The Ladies Man. She also appeared in episodes of the TV detective shows Surfside 6 and 77 Sunset Strip, and the comedy-drama Father Knows Best.\n\n\n== Whipped Cream & Other Delights ==\nArt director Peter Whorf, at the time engaged to Erickson's best friend, used Erickson on many Capitol Records shoots. During this time, she became acquainted with trumpeter and A&M Records co-founder Herb Alpert, and watched part of the recording of The Lonely Bull album in Alpert's garage in 1962.The photo shoot for the cover of the 1965 Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass album Whipped Cream & Other Delights \u2014 which remained in the Billboard top 10 for 61 weeks, and whose sexy cover would become a cultural touchstone \u2014 began in mid-morning, went on through the afternoon, and paid Erickson  approximately $1,500 plus expenses. The shoot took place in Whorf's studio, a converted garage. Erickson, 29 years old and three months pregnant, sat on a stool with a white Christmas blanket covering her from the waist down, and wore a bikini with the straps down. She then was covered with shaving cream, which unlike whipped cream would not melt under the hot photographic lights, with a dollop of whipped cream on her head. As the shoot progressed, the shaving cream began to slide down her breasts slightly. Months later, Whorf sent her two outtakes. When she saw the more risqu\u00e9 pictures, she took them over to a girlfriend's house and hid them behind the friend's refrigerator, not wanting her conservative husband to find them.

This is usually shown by a graph of the orbital effective potential which is lowest at the ISCO.\n\n\n== Rotating black holes ==\nThe case for rotating black holes is somewhat more complicated.

"Inertial_balance| Measuring instruments| Classical mechanics stubs| Standards and measurement stubs| ","An inertial balance is a device that allows the measurement of inertial mass (as opposed to gravitational mass for a regular balance) that can be operated in the microgravity environment space where weight is negligible (e.g. in the International Space Station.) The principle of operation is based on a vibrating spring-mass system. The frequency of vibration will depend on the unknown mass, being higher for lower mass. The object to be measured is placed in the inertial balance, and a spring mechanism starts the oscillation. The time needed to complete a given number of cycles is measured. Knowing the characteristic spring constant and damping coefficient of the spring system, the mass of the object can be computed according to the harmonic oscillator model.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMass\nHarmonic oscillator\n\n\n== External links ==\nInertial mass measurement in the International Space Station (dead link?)\nNASA's instructions for constructing an inertial balance\nInertial balance demonstration for the physics classroom"

FOST is the authority responsible for the operational sea training of all personnel of Indian Naval and Coast Guard ships and submarines. The organisation was instituted in 1992 and is the common authority to maintain battle efficiency standards. It also provides training to navies and maritime security forces of friendly foreign countries (FFC). Headquartered in Kochi, the FOST operates under the control of the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief Southern Naval Command.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn October 1977, an organisation called the Weapons workup organisation (WWO) was set up. This was aimed at increasing the efficiency of ships' weapons. In 1981, it was re-designated Warship Workup Organisation in Bombay. An additional WWO was set up in Vizag - WWO (V) - for the Eastern Fleet. In March 1992, a local flotilla workup team (LWT) was set up for the ships operating under the Maharashtra Naval Area. These three organisations - WWO (B), WWO (V) and LWT - reported into the Flag Officer Commanding Western Fleet (FOCWF), Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet (FOCEF) and Flag Officer Maharashtra Area (FOMA) respectively.In 1992, a single authority was created to consolidate work-up efforts and serve as the safety authority responsible for the operational sea training (OST) of all ships. The organisation would be headed by a rear admiral of the executive branch and be based out of Kochi. As the Southern Naval Command (SNC) was the training command of the Navy, the FOST would report into the FOC-in-C SNC. An Indian Navy Workup Team (INWT) was created at Kochi and local workup units were created at Bombay and Vizag - LWT (West) and LWT (East).\nOn 4 June 1993, the first ship was trained by FOST - the Khukri-class corvette INS Khanjar (P47). In 2000, the Sukanya-class patrol vessel INS Sarayu (P54) was sold to the Sri Lanka Navy. She was commissioned as SLNS Sayura in November 2000. The Sayura was the first foreign ship whose operational sea training was conducted by INWT and FOST.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe INWT at Kochi works up all major warships - Aircraft Carriers, Anti-submarine warfare and Guided-missile destroyers, frigates and other fleet units. The INWT is under the operational control of FOST and administrative control of FOC-in-C SNC.\nThe LWT (West) and LWT (East) work up Seaward-class defense boats, missile boats, Anti Submarine Patrol Vessels, Ocean-going tugs, etc. They are under the operational control of FOST and administrative control of FOC-in-C of Western Naval Command and Eastern Naval Command respectively.\n\n\n== Training regime ==\nThe FOST conducts multiple types of training which encompasses all spheres of ship activity. There are short training programs like the Sea Safety Checks (SSC) and Operational Sea Checks (OSC) for a duration of 7 \u2013 10 days on selected disciplines like Bridge Work, Damage Control and Fire Fighting, Machinery Breakdown Drills and Ship Safety.It also conducts full work-up programs, under the ambit of OST, from three weeks (for minor war vessels) to six weeks (for aircraft carriers). It ensures a thorough training of the ship to achieve the prescribed performance standards. On completion, it conducts an operational readiness assessment at sea and certifies the ships operational status and the areas of improvement. The OST covers all operational/combat functions - aviation, ship management, hull, seamanship, NBCD, engineering, electrical, logistics and medical.\n\n\n== List of FOST ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nSouthern Naval Command\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSingh, Anup (2018), Blue Waters Ahoy!, The Indian Navy 2001-2010, HarperCollins Publishers India, ISBN 9789353025526\nHiranandani, G.M.

"Borehole| Chinese inventions| Drilling technology| Hole making| ","A borehole is a narrow shaft bored in the ground, either vertically or horizontally. A borehole may be constructed for many different purposes, including the extraction of water, other liquids (such as petroleum) or gases (such as natural gas), as part of a geotechnical investigation, environmental site assessment,  mineral exploration,  temperature measurement, as a pilot hole for installing piers or underground utilities, for geothermal installations, or for underground storage of unwanted substances, e.g. in carbon capture and storage.\n\n\n== Importance ==\nEngineers and environmental consultants use the term borehole to collectively describe all of the various types of holes drilled as part of a geotechnical investigation or environmental site assessment (a so-called Phase II ESA). This includes holes advanced to collect soil samples, water samples or rock cores, to advance in situ sampling equipment, or to install monitoring wells or piezometers.  Samples collected from boreholes are often tested in a laboratory to determine their physical properties, or to assess levels of various chemical constituents or contaminants.\nTypically, a borehole used as a water well is completed by installing a vertical pipe (casing) and well screen to keep the borehole from caving. This also helps prevent surface contaminants from entering the borehole and protects any installed pump from drawing in sand and sediment. Oil and natural gas wells are completed in a similar, albeit usually more complex, manner.\nAs detailed in proxy (climate), borehole temperature measurements at a series of different depths can be effectively \"

The name Sch\u00f6nbrunn (meaning \u201cbeautiful spring\u201d) has its roots in an artesian well from which water was consumed by the court.\nThe 1,441-room Rococo palace is one of the most important architectural, cultural, and historic monuments in the country. The history of the palace and its vast gardens spans over 300 years, reflecting the changing tastes, interests, and aspirations of successive Habsburg monarchs. It has been a major tourist attraction since the mid-1950s. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1569, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II purchased a large floodplain of the Wien river beneath a hill, situated between Meidling and Hietzing. The former owner, in 1548, had erected a mansion called Katterburg. The emperor ordered the area to be fenced and put game  there such as pheasants, ducks, deer and boar, in order for it to serve as the court's recreational hunting ground. In a small separate part of the area, \u201cexotic\u201d birds such as turkeys and peafowl were kept. Fishponds were also built.\n\nDuring the next century, the area was used as a hunting and recreation ground. Eleonora Gonzaga, who loved hunting, spent much time there and was bequeathed the area as her widow's residence after the death of her husband, Ferdinand II. From 1638 to 1643, she added a palace to the Katterburg mansion, while in 1642 came the first mention of the name \u201cSch\u00f6nbrunn\u201d on an invoice. The origins of the Sch\u00f6nbrunn orangery seem to go back to Eleonora Gonzaga as well. The Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace in its present form was built and remodelled during the 1740\u201350s during the reign of empress Maria Theresa who received the estate as a wedding gift. Franz I commissioned the redecoration of the palace exterior in the neoclassical style as it appears today.\nFranz Joseph, the longest-reigning emperor of Austria, was born at Sch\u00f6nbrunn and spent a great deal of his life there. He died there, at the age of 86, on 21 November 1916. Following the downfall of the Habsburg monarchy in November 1918, the palace became the property of the newly founded Austrian Republic and was preserved as a museum.\nAfter World War II and during the Allied Occupation of Austria (1945\u201455), Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace was requisitioned to provide office space for both the British Delegation to the Allied Commission for Austria, and for the headquarters for the small British Military Garrison present in Vienna. With the reestablishment of the Austrian republic in 1955, the palace once again became a museum. It is still sometimes used for important events such as the meeting between U.S. president John F. Kennedy and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev in 1961.\nSince 1992 the palace and gardens have been owned and administered by the Schloss Sch\u00f6nbrunn Kultur-und Betriebsges.m.b.H., a limited-liability company wholly owned by the Republic of Austria. The company conducts preservation and restoration of all palace properties without state subsidies. UNESCO catalogued Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace on the World Heritage List in 1996, together with its gardens, as a remarkable Baroque ensemble and example of synthesis of the arts (Gesamtkunstwerk).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Gardens ==\n\nThe sculpted garden space between the palace and the Neptune Fountain is called the Great Parterre. The French garden, a big part of the area, was planned by Jean Trehet, a disciple of Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre, in 1695. It contains, among other things, a maze.\nThe complex however includes many more attractions: besides the Tiergarten, an orangerie erected around 1755, staple luxuries of European palaces of its type, a palm house (replacing, by 1882, around ten earlier and smaller glass houses in the western part of the park) is noteworthy. Western parts were turned into English garden style in 1828\u20131852.\nThe area called Meidlinger Vertiefung (engl.: depression of Meidling) to the west of the castle was turned into a play area and drill ground for the children of the Habsburgs in the 19th century. At this time it was common to use parks for the military education of young princes. Whereas the miniature bastion, which was built for this purpose, does not exist anymore, the garden pavilion that was used as shelter still does. It was turned into a caf\u00e9 in 1927 and is known as Landtmann\u2019s Jausen Station since 2013.At the outmost western edge, a botanical garden going back to an earlier arboretum was re-arranged in 1828, when the Old Palm House was built. A modern enclosure for Orangutans, was restored besides a restaurant and office rooms in 2009.\n\n\n=== Sculptures ===\n\nThe Great Parterre of Sch\u00f6nbrunn has 32 sculptures, which represent deities and virtues.\n\n\n=== Gloriette ===\n\nThe garden axis points towards a 60-metre-high (200 ft) hill, which since 1775 has been crowned by the Gloriette structure (Fischer von Erlach had initially planned to erect the main palace on the top of this hill).\nMaria Theresa decided the Gloriette should be designed to glorify Habsburg power and the Just War (a war that would be carried out of \u201cnecessity\u201d and lead to peace), and thereby ordered the builders to recycle \u201cotherwise useless stone\u201d which was left from the near-demolition of Schloss Neugeb\u00e4ude. The same material was also to be used for the Roman ruin.\nThe Gloriette was destroyed in the Second World War, but had already been restored by 1947, and was restored again in 1995.\nThe Gloriette today houses a caf\u00e9 and an observation deck which provides panoramic views of the city.\n\n\n=== Roman Ruins ===\n\nOriginally known as the Ruin of Carthage, the Roman Ruin is a set of follies that was designed by the architect Johann Ferdinand Hetzendorf von Hohenberg and erected as an entirely new architectural feature in 1778. Fully integrated into its parkland surroundings, this architectural ensemble should be understood as a picturesque horticultural feature and not simply as a ruin, which due to lack of maintenance it had increasingly grown to resemble prior to its recent restoration.\nThe fashion for picturesque ruins that became widespread with the rise of the Romantic movement soon after the middle of the 18th century symbolized both the decline of once great powers and the preservation of the remains of a heroic past. Erected at the same time not far from the Roman Ruin, the Obelisk Fountain was intended to complete the iconographic program of the park at Sch\u00f6nbrunn as a symbol of stability and permanence.\nThe Roman Ruin consists of a rectangular pool enclosed by a massive arch with lateral walls, evoking the impression of an ancient edifice slowly crumbling into the ground. In the pool in front of the ruin is a seemingly haphazard arrangement of stone fragments supporting a figural group which symbolizes the rivers Vltava and Elbe.\n\n\n== Activities at Sch\u00f6nbrunn today ==\nSch\u00f6nbrunn is Vienna's most popular tourist destination, which has been attended by 3,800,000 visitors in 2017. The whole Sch\u00f6nbrunn complex with Tiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn, Palmenhaus, W\u00fcstenhaus, the Wagenburg, and The Schoenbrunn Palace Concerts accounted for more than five million visitors in 2009.\nAt the official website tickets can be purchased in advance for tours. In addition to tours and tour packages, many classical concerts featuring the music of Mozart and his contemporaries can be enjoyed with the added benefit of more time in the spectacular halls, Orangerie, or Schlosstheater.\nThe annual Summer Night Concert Sch\u00f6nbrunn is held on the grounds of Sch\u00f6nbrunn.\n\n\n=== The Schoenbrunn Palace Concerts ===\nThe Schoenbrunn Palace Concerts are served by The Schoenbrunn Palace Orchestra. Founded in 1997, it is led by the chief opera conductor Maestro Guido Mancusi since 1998. He also founded Chamber Opera Schoenbrunn in the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace Concert series. \nIn Vienna, they offer daily concerts at the original location of the world-famous contest between Mozart & Salieri (1786). They have a wealth of experience working with singers and ballet dancers. The Orchestra has regular worldwide tours in China, Japan, Singapore, Russia, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Estonia, Germany, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Brazil.\n\n\n=== Film and television productions ===\nThe gardens and palace have been the location for many films and television productions including such productions as the Sissi trilogy in the 1950s, A Breath of Scandal with Sophia Loren, and also briefly in James Bond's The Living Daylights when Bond and Kara are riding through the palace garden; the palace is also seen during the end credits. The comedy The Great Race was filmed there in 1965. Jackie Chan shot scenes for Armour of God on the grounds. More recently, the television drama  The Crown Prince starring Max von Thun as Crown Prince Rudolf and Klaus Maria Brandauer as Kaiser Franz-Josef was filmed there.\nThe Austrian television series, Kommissar Rex has shot several episodes there. In the Kuroshitsuji episode 2: His Butler, Omnipotent, Sebastian Michaelis tells his master that he was a guest at the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace soirees before his contract was sealed with Ciel as he teaches the young master how to dance.

"Sessa_Orchid_Sanctuary| Orchid organizations| Protected areas of Arunachal Pradesh| West Kameng district| 1989 establishments in Arunachal Pradesh| Protected areas established in 1989| ","Sessa Orchid Sanctuary is a 100 km2 protected area of India in the Himalayan foothills in Bhalukpong Forest Division of West Kameng District, Arunachal Pradesh.  It conjoins Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary to the southwest. It is a part of the  Kameng Protected Area Complex (KPAC), which is an Elephant Reserve.  See map. The department of Environment & Forests has developed trekking routes for visitors to enjoy the natural habitats of orchids. There are deep gorges and valleys, high peaks and rugged terrain that are rewarding for nature lovers and adventure tourists. A nursery includes representative specimens of various orchid species of the sanctuary and a demonstration farm of Cymbidium hybrids for cut-flower production. Most of Sessa has traditionally been claimed by the Bugun tribe as part of their territory.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nSessa and Eaglenest together occupy a rough east\u2013west rectangle with Sessa occupying the north-east quadrant.  The Bhalukpong-Bomdila highway (and Pakke immediately beyond) are its eastern boundary. It is bounded to the north by the Tenga River valley. Altitude  is 900 metres (2,953 ft) to 3,250 metres (10,663 ft). \nSessa and Eaglenest ridges rise to 3,250 metres (10,663 ft) and 2,700 metres (8,858 ft)  respectively and are the first major barriers to the monsoon as it moves north from the plains of Assam. These ridges get over 3,000 millimetres (120 in) of rain on the southern slopes and about 1,500 millimetres (59 in) on the northern slopes.Sessa sanctuary is drained by the Tippi Naala (Tippi river), which joins the Kameng river at Tippi village on the Bhalukpong-Bomdila highway. Topographic map Sessa is part of the Kameng protected area complex (KPAC), the largest contiguous closed-canopy forest tract of Arunachal Pradesh, which includes Sessa, Eaglenest, Pakke, Nameri, and Sonai Rupai sanctuaries and associated reserved forest blocks. The Complex covers 3500 km2 in area and ranges from 100 metres (328 ft) to 3,300 metres (10,827 ft)3300m in altitude.\n\n\n== Orchids ==\nSessa is noted for the occurrence of more than 200 orchid species with 5 new and endemic species. Sub-tropical types include the genera Dendrobium, Bulbophyllum, Coelogyne, Eria, Phaius and Liparis. The sanctuary is unique in having 7 endemic species of saprotrophic orchids. 12 rare species of different families were found in one study of the area.\n\n\n== Orchid Research and Development Centre ==\nThe Government of Arunachal Pradesh in the late 1970s created a post of orchidologist in the Forest Department and in 1989 established the Orchid Research and Development Centre (ORDC) at Tipi, and the Sessa Orchid Sanctuary 20 km awy. The ORDC is actively engaged in exploration and collection of orchid species, cultivation in orchidaria and gardens for their taxonomic study, conservation of rare and endangered species, creation of germplasm collections and multiplication of rare species through tissue culture techniques.\nThe ORDC discovered the new species: Biermannia jainiana, Cleistoma tricallosum, Dendrobium kentrophyllum, Epipogium sessanum, Eria jengingensis, Eria lohitensis, Gastrodia arunachalenisis and Herminium longilonbatum.,\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF), a consortium of major international and\nregional organizations, has identified the Eastern Himalayan region around Arunachal Pradesh\n(Nepal, Bhutan and all of North-East India) as a critical global biodiversity rich area\ndeserving of conservation focus. They identified the North-Bank Landscape (i.e. north bank of Brahmaputra, extending up the Eaglenest and Sessa slopes) and the Tawang region as worthy of particular focus.Sessa is within the Conservation International Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot area.BirdLife International has designated Sessa and Eaglenest Sanctuaries as an Important Bird Area (IBA IN344), with Blyth's tragopan identified as a vulnerable species of the area.\n\n\n== Visitor information ==\nVisitors may contact the DFO Pakke WLS Division, Seijosa, East Kameng District or The Range Officer (WL), Sessa Orchid Sanctuary, Sessa, West Kameng District or the Asst.

"Argus_%E2%80%93_Audit_Record_Generation_and_Utilization_System| Network flow problem| Network analyzers| Network performance| Software performance management| Network management| Packets (information technology)| Internet Protocol based network software| ","Argus \u2013 the Audit Record Generation and Utilization System is the first implementation of network flow monitoring, and is an ongoing open source network flow monitor project.  Started by Carter Bullard in 1984 at Georgia Tech, and developed for cyber security at Carnegie Mellon University in the early 1990s, Argus has been an important contributor to Internet cyber security technology over its 30 years.   [1].\n\nThe Argus Project is focused on developing all aspects of large scale network situational awareness and network audit trail establishment in support of Network Operations (NetOps), Performance and Security Management.  Motivated by the telco Call detail record (CDR), Argus attempts to generate network metadata that can be used to perform a large number of network management tasks.   Argus is used by many universities, corporations and government entities including US DISA, DoD, DHS, FFRDCs, GLORIAD and is a Top 100 Internet Security Tool.   Argus is designed to be a real-time situational awareness system, and its data can be used to track, alarm and alert on wire-line network conditions.  The data can also be used to establish a comprehensive audit of all network traffic, as described in the Red Book, US DoD NCSC-TG-005, supplementing traditional Intrusion detection system (IDS) based network security.  The audit trail is traditionally used as historical network traffic measurement data for network forensics and Network Behavior Anomaly Detection (NBAD).  Argus has been used extensively in cybersecurity, end-to-end performance analysis, and more recently, software-defined networking (SDN) research.  Argus has also been a topic in network management standards development. RMON (1995)  and IPFIX (2001).Argus is composed of an advanced comprehensive network flow data generator, the Argus monitor, which processes packets (either capture files or live packet data) and generates detailed network traffic flow status reports of all the flows in the packet stream.  Argus monitors all network traffic, data plane, control plane and management plane, not just Internet Protocol (IP) traffic.  Argus captures much of the packet dynamics and semantics of each flow, with a great deal of data reduction, so you can store, process, inspect and analyze large amounts of network data efficiently.  Argus provides reachability, availability, connectivity, duration, rate, load, good-put, loss, jitter, retransmission (data networks), and delay metrics for all network flows, and captures most attributes that are available from the packet contents, such as Layer 2 addresses, tunnel identifiers (MPLS, GRE, IPsec, etc...), protocol ids, SAP's, hop-count, options, L4 transport identification (RTP detection), host flow control indications, etc...  Argus has implemented a number of packet dynamics metrics specifically designed for cyber security.  Argus detects human typing behavior in any flow, but of particular interest is key-stroke detection in encrypted SSH tunnels.  and Argus generates the Producer Consumer Ratio (PCR) which indicates whether a network entity is a data producer and/or consumer, an important property when evaluating the potential for a node to be involved in an Advanced persistent threat (APT) mediated exfiltration.\nArgus is an Open Source (GPL) project, owned and managed by QoSient, LLC, and has been ported to most operating systems and many hardware accelerated platforms, such as Bivio, Pluribus, Arista, and Tilera. The software should be portable to many other environments with little or no modifications. Performance is such that auditing an entire enterprise's Internet activity can be accomplished using modest computing resources.\n\n\n== Supported platforms ==\nLinux: Unix operating system running the Linux kernel\nSolaris: Unix operating system developed by Sun Microsystems\nBSD: Unix operating system family (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD)\nOS X: Unix operating system developed by Apple Inc.\nIRIX: Unix operating system developed by Silicon Graphics\nAIX, Unix operating system developed by IBM\nWindows, (under Cygwin) operating system developed by Microsoft\nOpenWrt: Unix operation system running the Linux kernel on embedded devices\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArgus website"

L\u00fc Chen Chung is best known for his 30-year endeavor translating the Bible to a Chinese language version.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nL\u00fc was born in Nan'an county of Southern Fujian, China. In 1906, due to a plague that ravaged in China, he and his two cousins were orphaned when he was eight. With full support from British Presbyterian missionary Alan S. Moore Anderson, the three orphans enrolled into Pei Yuan Middle School in Quanzhou, which Anderson had established in 1904. With exceptional results from his studies, L\u00fc received scholarship to study at University of Hong Kong in 1916 and graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in 1921. He went back to his alma mater, Pei Yuan Middle School to teach for one year and married his wife Huang Luo Qi (\u9ec4\u7f57\u7eee) then. In 1922, he went to Yenching University (a.k.a. Yanjing University) to read Theology and graduated in 1925. While he was in Yenching, he also studied Hebrew and Greek, which allowed him to be an effective Hebrew Bible translator later in life.\n\n\n== Career ==\nUpon graduating from Yenching in 1925, L\u00fc returned to Fujian and took up the vice-principal position at South Fukien Theological College in Gulangyu, Xiamen. During his 14-year tenure, he taught prospective pastors and research the original text of the Bible when needed.In 1939, with the backdrop of the Second Sino-Japanese War and increasing frequency of conflicts in Xiamen, traffic between Xiamen mainland and the Gulangyu International Settlement was restricted. During this tumultuous times, L\u00fc received a revelation and was inspired to start translating the Bible. In 1940, L\u00fc went to back to his alma mater, Yenching University with his family to start the translation work. Additionally, he took up teaching Greek language in the university. When the university closed its doors between 1941 and 1945 due to the war, L\u00fc and his family was hosted by Philippe de Vargas in Beiping, and L\u00fc continued his translation efforts. L\u00fc returned to Yenching in autumn of 1945 when it reopened after the surrender of Japanese occupation forces. In 1946, the initial edition of his New Testament translation was published by Yenching University with 500 copies in circulation. L\u00fc encouraged criticism and suggestions to be delivered to him at the university in his foreword so that he could revise the translation further.To further his understanding of the Bible and his translation efforts, he enrolled into Union Theological Seminary in New York in 1946 and later at Westminster College in England. He was ordained in 1948.He returned to Beiping in autumn of 1948 to continue his translation efforts. However, he developed a severe case of asthma and could not tolerate the cold winter there. He and Huang returned back to Fujian and temporarily worked at Fukien Christian University.In 1949, with the sponsorship from the British Bible Society, L\u00fc and Huang went to Hong Kong to work on a revised translation of the New Testament (\u65b0\u7ea6\u65b0\u8bd1\u521d\u7a3f). In 1952, the revised translation was published by the Hong Kong Bible Society. L\u00fc shifted his focus on translating the Old Testament until 1970 when both Old and New Testaments were published by the Hong Kong Bible Society. In recognition of his translation efforts, he received an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Hong Kong University in 1973.\n\n\n=== Bible translation sources ===\nThe first translation of New Testament which started in 1940, was translated from Alexander Souter's New Testament: Oxford Greek Testament.For the 1970 translation of the Bible which was published in Hong Kong, the revised translation of the New Testament, was translated from the 17th edition of Eberhard Nestle's Novum Testamentum Graece, while the Old Testament relied on various texts such as the Masoretic Text.\n\n\n== Personal life and demise ==\nL\u00fc was married to Huang Luo Qi (\u9ec4\u7f57\u7eee) in 1921. Huang was afflicted with Alzheimer's disease in 1975 and passed away in 1978 in Hong Kong. Together, they had 5 children, 3 boys and 2 girls. The two youngest, a boy and a girl dead in their childhoods, while the eldest, a daughter, died in 1944. They dedicated their first son (the second child), John Lu (\u5415\u8363\u5149) to the Lord. John went on to be the vice-moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Singapore and Malaysia in 1952. At the same time, John was also a faculty at the Trinity Theological College of Singapore, delivering lessons in Chinese. John passed away in 2000.In 1983, L\u00fc migrated to Singapore and lived with John. L\u00fc died at age 89 in Singapore on 10 March 1988.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"

"Ion-exchange_resin| Polymers| Water| Synthetic resins| Polyelectrolytes| ","An ion-exchange resin or ion-exchange polymer is a resin or polymer that acts as a medium for ion exchange. It is an insoluble matrix (or support structure) normally in the form of small (0.25\u20131.43 mm radius) microbeads, usually white or yellowish, fabricated from an organic polymer substrate. The beads are typically porous, providing a large surface area on and inside them where the trapping of ions occurs along with the accompanying release of other ions, and thus the process is called ion exchange. There are multiple types of ion-exchange resin. Most commercial resins are made of polystyrene sulfonate.\n\nIon-exchange resins are widely used in different separation, purification, and decontamination processes. The most common examples are water softening and water purification. In many cases ion-exchange resins were introduced in such processes as a more flexible alternative to the use of natural or artificial zeolites. Also, ion-exchange resins are highly effective in the biodiesel filtration process.\n\n\n== Types of resins ==\nMost typical ion-exchange resins are based on crosslinked polystyrene. The actual ion-exchanging sites are introduced after polymerisation. Additionally, in the case of polystyrene, crosslinking is introduced by copolymerisation of styrene and a few percent of divinylbenzene. Crosslinking decreases ion-exchange capacity of the resin and prolongs the time needed to accomplish the ion-exchange processes but improves the robustness of the resin. Particle size also influences the resin parameters; smaller particles have larger outer surface, but cause larger head loss in the column processes.Besides being made as bead-shaped materials, ion-exchange resins are also produced as membranes. These ion-exchange membranes, which are made of highly cross-linked ion-exchange resins that allow passage of ions, but not of water, are used for electrodialysis.\nFour main types of ion-exchange resins differ in their functional groups:\n\nstrongly acidic, typically featuring sulfonic acid groups, e.g. sodium polystyrene sulfonate or polyAMPS,\nstrongly basic, typically featuring quaternary amino groups, for example, trimethylammonium groups, e.g. polyAPTAC),\nweakly acidic, typically featuring carboxylic acid groups,\nweakly basic, typically featuring primary, secondary, and/or tertiary amino groups, e.g. polyethylene amine.Specialised ion-exchange resins are also known such as chelating resins (iminodiacetic acid, thiourea-based resins, and many others).\nAnion resins and cation resins are the two most common resins used in the ion-exchange process. While anion resins attract negatively charged ions, cation resins attract positively charged ions.\n\n\n=== Anion resins ===\nAnion resins may be either strongly or weakly basic. Strongly basic anion resins maintain their negative charge across a wide pH range, whereas weakly basic anion resins are neutralized at higher pH levels. Weakly basic resins do not maintain their charge at a high pH because they undergo deprotonation. They do, however, offer excellent mechanical and chemical stability. This, combined with a high rate of ion exchange, make weakly base anion resins well suited for the organic salts.\nFor anion resins, regeneration typically involves treatment of the resin with a strongly basic solution, e.g. aqueous sodium hydroxide. During regeneration, the regenerant chemical is passed through the resin, and trapped negative ions are flushed out, renewing the resin exchange capacity.\n\n\n==== Cation-exchange resin ====\nFormula: R\u2212H acidic\nThe cation exchange method removes the hardness of water but induces acidity in it, which is further removed in the next stage of treatment of water by passing this acidic water through an anion exchange process.Reaction:\n\nR\u2212H + M+ = R\u2212M + H+.\n\n\n==== Anion-exchange resin ====\nFormula: \u2013NR4+OH\u2212Often these are styrene\u2013divinylbenzene copolymer resins that have quaternary ammonium cations as an integral part of the resin matrix.Reaction:\n\n\u2013NR4+OH\u2212 + HCl = \u2013NR4+Cl\u2212 + H2O.Anion-exchange chromatography makes use of this principle to extract and purify materials from mixtures or solutions.\n\n\n== Uses ==\n\n\n=== Water softening ===\n\nIn this application, ion-exchange resins are used to replace the magnesium and calcium ions found in hard water with sodium ions. When the resin is fresh, it contains sodium ions at its active sites. When in contact with a solution containing magnesium and calcium ions (but a low concentration of sodium ions), the magnesium and calcium ions preferentially migrate out of solution to the active sites on the resin, being replaced in solution by sodium ions. This process reaches equilibrium with a much lower concentration of magnesium and calcium ions in solution than was started with.\n\nThe resin can be recharged by washing it with a solution containing a high concentration of sodium ions (e.g. it has large amounts of common salt (NaCl) dissolved in it). The calcium and magnesium ions migrate from the resin, being replaced by sodium ions from the solution until a new equilibrium is reached. The salt is used to recharge an ion-exchange resin, which itself is used to soften the water.\n\n\n=== Water purification ===\n\nIn this application, ion-exchange resins are used to remove poisonous (e.g. copper) and hazardous metal (e.g. lead or cadmium) ions from solution, replacing them with more innocuous ions, such as sodium and potassium.\nFew ion-exchange resins remove chlorine or organic contaminants from water \u2013 this is usually done by using an activated charcoal filter mixed in with the resin. There are some ion-exchange resins that do remove organic ions, such as MIEX (magnetic ion-exchange) resins. Domestic water purification resin is not usually recharged \u2013 the resin is discarded when it can no longer be used.\nWater of highest purity is required for electronics, scientific experiments, production of superconductors, and nuclear industry, among others. Such water is produced using ion-exchange processes or combinations of membrane and ion-exchange methods.\n\n\n=== Ion exchange in metal separation ===\n\nIon-exchange processes are used to separate and purify metals, including separating uranium from plutonium and other actinides, including thorium; and lanthanum, neodymium, ytterbium, samarium, lutetium, from each other and the other lanthanides. There are two series of rare-earth metals, the lanthanides and the actinides. Members of each family have very similar chemical and physical properties. Ion exchange was for many years the only practical way to separate the rare earths in large quantities. This application was developed in the 1940s by Frank Spedding.  Subsequently, solvent extraction has mostly supplanted use of ion-exchange resins except for the highest-purity products.\nA very important case is the PUREX process (plutonium-uranium extraction process), which is used to separate the plutonium and the uranium from the spent fuel products from a nuclear reactor, and to be able to dispose of the waste products. Then, the plutonium and uranium are available for making nuclear-energy materials, such as new reactor fuel and nuclear weapons.\nIon-exchange beads are also an essential component in in-situ leach uranium mining. In-situ recovery involves the extraction of uranium-bearing water (grading as low as 0.05% U3O8) through boreholes. The extracted uranium solution is then filtered through the resin beads. Through an ion-exchange process, the resin beads attract uranium from the solution. Uranium-loaded resins are then transported to a processing plant, where U3O8 is separated from the resin beads, and yellowcake is produced. The resin beads can then be returned to the ion-exchange facility, where they are reused.\nThe ion-exchange process is also used to separate other sets of very similar chemical elements, such as zirconium and hafnium, which incidentally is also very important for the nuclear industry. Zirconium is practically transparent to free neutrons, used in building reactors, but hafnium is a very strong absorber of neutrons, used in reactor control rods.\n\n\n=== Catalysis ===\nIon exchange resins are used in organic synthesis, e.g. for esterification and hydrolysis.  Being high surface area and insoluble, they are suitable for vapor-phase and liquid-phase reactions.  Examples can be found where basic (OH\u2212-form) of ion exchange resins are used to neutralize of ammonium salts and convert quaternary ammonium halides to hydroxides.  Acidic (H+-form) ion exchange resins have been used as solid acid catalysts for scission of ether protecting groups. and for rearrangement reactions.\n\n\n=== Juice purification ===\nIon-exchange resins are used in the manufacture of fruit juices such as orange and cranberry juice, where they are used to remove bitter-tasting components and so improve the flavor. This allows tart or poorer-tasting fruit sources to be used for juice production.\n\n\n=== Sugar manufacturing ===\nIon-exchange resins are used in the manufacturing of sugar from various sources. They are used to help convert one type of sugar into another type of sugar, and to decolorize and purify sugar syrups.\n\n\n=== Pharmaceuticals ===\nIon-exchange resins are used in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, not only for catalyzing certain reactions, but also for isolating and purifying pharmaceutical active ingredients.\nThree ion-exchange resins, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, colestipol, and cholestyramine, are used as active ingredients. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a strongly acidic ion-exchange resin and is used to treat hyperkalemia.  Colestipol is a weakly basic ion-exchange resin and is used to treat hypercholesterolemia. Cholestyramine is a strongly basic ion-exchange resin and is also used to treat hypercholesterolemia. Colestipol and cholestyramine are known as bile acid sequestrants.\nIon-exchange resins are also used as excipients in pharmaceutical formulations such as tablets, capsules, gums, and suspensions. In these uses the ion-exchange resin can have several different functions, including taste-masking, extended release, tablet disintegration, increased bioavailability, and improving the chemical stability of the active ingredients.\nSelective polymeric chelators have been proposed for maintenance therapy of some pathologies, where chronic ion accumulation occurs, such as Wilson disease (where copper accumulation occurs) or hereditary hemochromatosis (iron overload, where iron accumulation occurs) These polymers or particles have a negligible or null systemic biological availability and they are designed to form stable complexes with Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the GIT and thus limiting the uptake of these ions and their long-term accumulation. Although this method has only a limited efficacy, unlike small-molecular chelators (deferasirox, deferiprone, or deferoxamine), such an approach may have only minor side effects in sub-chronic studies. Interestingly, the simultaneous chelation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ increases the treatment efficacy.\n\n\n=== CO2 Capture from Ambient Air ===\nAnion exchange resins readily absorb CO2 when dry and release it again when exposed to moisture. This makes them one of the most promising materials for direct carbon capture from ambient air, or direct air capture, since the moisture swing replaces the more energy-intensive temperature swing or pressure swing used with other sorbents. A prototype demonstrating this process has been developed by Klaus Lackner at the Center for Negative Carbon Emissions.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPolyelectrolyte\nWater softening\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"

While the patrol was in formation on the trail searching for a bandit group, with which contact had just previously been had, a rifle grenade fell from its carrier, carried by a member of the patrol, and struck a rock, igniting the detonator. Several men of the patrol were in close proximity of the grenade at the time. Corporal Truesdale, who was several yards away at the time, could easily have sought cover and safety for himself but instead, knowing full well the grenade would explode within two or three seconds, and with utter disregard for his own personal safety, and at the risk of his own life, rushed for the grenade, grasped it in his right hand and attempted to throw it away from the patrol before it exploded. The grenade exploded in his hand, blowing it off and inflicting serious multiple wounds about his body. Corporal Truesdale, by his actions, took the full shock of the explosion of the grenade upon himself, thereby saving the lives of, or serious injury to, his comrades in arms.

Its mission is to supply effectively and efficiently regular services to maintain the health and well-being of people in Hong Kong.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Hong Kong Government decided to form the Auxiliary Medical Service in order to create a force that could assist the regular medical services during emergencies. The establishment of the AMS was announced in the government gazette on 22 December 1950. In early 1951 the AMS made a call for volunteers, including ordinary people who could be trained as auxiliary nurses, ambulance drivers, and other roles. As the population of Hong Kong swelled with refugees from China in the post-Chinese Communist Revolution years, many lived in substandard housing areas susceptible to fires, landslips, storms, and other disasters, for which the AMS played a role in delivering emergency medical treatment. In the 1950s, AMS worked with St. John Ambulance to establish first aid posts all around the territory.The AMS was involved in major events like the Shek Kip Mei Fire in 1953, Typhoon Wendy in 1962 and landslides caused by heavy rainstorms in 1972. It also served during SARS in Hong Kong in 2003 and 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Normally, it sends out volunteers to fireworks displays, marathons, and other major events.\nIn 1983, AMS became an independent government operation branch under the Security Department of the Government Secretariat. A public hotline for enquiry about the services of AMS and a Non-Emergency Ambulance Transport team were set up in 1995 and 1996 respectively. The Youth Ambassador Scheme has also been implemented in 1997 with the objectives to encourage young people to have a healthy lifestyle and promote a sense of civic duties.\nAs of 2007, the number of volunteers had grown to 4,418.\n\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nA list of vehicles used in the past and present:\nPast\n\nLand Rover Defender ambulances\nMercedes-Benz E-310 ambulances\nToyota Coaster ambulance\nHonda CBX750 motorcycle\nBMW R850RT motorcyclePresent\n\nMercedes-Benz 516CDI ambulance\nBMW R900RT motorcycle\nNissan Urvan Mobile Command Post (MCP)\nMerida Mountain Bike (CRU)\n\n\n== Organisation ==\n\nThe Auxiliary Medical Service has over 4,700 uniformed members, and is divided into six columns:\n\nHQ Column\nOperations Wing 1\nHong Kong Island Operating Region\nKowloon East Operating Region\nKowloon West Operating Region\nOperations Wing 2\nNew Territories East Operating Region\nNew Territories West Operating Region\nTraining and Development Column\nMedical and Paramedic Column\nLogistics and Support ColumnThe headquarters column is composed of civil service staff of the AMS.\nThe operations wings are responsible for frontline work and account for the majority of members.\nThe training and development column is responsible for providing first aid, evacuation, and infection control training to all members.\nThe medical and paramedic column is responsible for the Health Protection Section (HPU), Emergency Task Force, and Reserve Personnel Section. Its members are professional doctors, nurses, and professionally trained personnel. In the event of a major incident, the medical and paramedic column will provide personnel to lead in rescue and medical efforts.\nThe logistics and support column is responsible for the delivery of materials and members to stations and incidents, as well as the welfare of members of the AMS.

"Karnataka_State_Cricket_Association| Cricket administration in India| 1933 establishments in India| Cricket in Karnataka| Sports organizations established in 1933| ","Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) is the governing body of Cricket in the Indian state of Karnataka. The association is affiliated to the Board of Control for Cricket in India and governs the Karnataka cricket team. The association was founded in 1933 and has been affiliated to the BCCI ever since. The KSCA operates the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore, which hosts International level Test, ODI and T20 cricket matches. It also operates a newly built stadium in Hubli and Belagavi.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Karnataka State Cricket Association was formerly known as Mysore Cricket Association. This association was founded during the year 1933 and gained affiliation to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 1934. Prof JC Rollo, Justice Mr P. Medappa, Capt. T Murari, Major YVK Murthy and Capt. MG Vijayasarathi were instrumental in getting the KSCA affiliated to the BCCI. JC Rollo, an Englishman, was the first president of the Association. The association was initially housed in a small room in the pavilion of Central college. In the 1950s and 1960s, the association was headed by SA Srinivasan and M.Chinnswamy. In 1975, KSCA made its home in KSCA stadium, where it is housed currently. Bangalore hosted its first ever international test match in the same year against the visiting West Indies. This cricket stadium, earlier named KSCA stadium is now named after Mr. M. Chinnaswamy, who was the Hon. Secretary of the association from 1953 to 1978 and remained the president till 1990.\nMysore state (which was renamed Karnataka in 1973) played its first Ranji trophy match on 4 November 1934 against Madras state (now Tamil Nadu). This was the first ever Ranji trophy game and till date the only Ranji trophy game, which was completed in a single day, with Mysore losing the game.\n\n\n== M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru ==\n\nThe M.Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru is owned by the Government of Karnataka and has been leased out to KSCA for promoting cricket. This stadium was earlier called as Karnataka State Cricket Association stadium (KSCA Stadium) and was later rechristened in tribute to Mr. M. Chinnaswamy who had served the KSCA for four decades and was president of Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) from 1977\u20131980. The stadium has been one of the premier cricket stadiums of India. Flanked by picturesque Cubbon Park and uptown MG Road, this three-decade-old stadium is situated in the heart of the city of Bengaluru. This 55,000 capacity stadium not only regularly hosts Tests, One Day International and other first class matches, but also other musical and cultural events. The stadium is the home ground of the Karnataka state cricket team and Royal Challengers Bangalore.\nAccording to their latest Annual Report, the KSCA is the first stadium in the world to employ solar photovoltaic system to covering nearly 45000 sq.ft of the east stand. It generates nearly 1,468,000 units in three years. In another first, the stadium installed an efficient sub-air system. This ensures that water from the field is drained in about eight minutes, after light to moderate rain showers.\n\n\n== D.R.Bendre KSCA Stadium Rajnagar, Hubli ==\n\nThe stadium has more than 50,000 capacity and was inaugurated by the then Chief Minister of Karnataka, Shri Jagadish Shettar in November 2012 at Rajnagar, Hubli owned by Karnataka State Cricket Association. Already divisional matches like U-16, U-19, KPL, Ranji Trophy are being hosted here.

"R160_(New_York_City_Subway_car)| New York City Subway rolling stock| Train-related introductions in 2006| Alstom multiple units| Kawasaki multiple units| ","The R160 is a class of New Technology subway cars built for the New York City Subway B Division. Entering service between 2006 and 2010, they replaced all R38, R40/A, and NYCT-operated R44 cars, and most R32 and R42 cars. The R160s are very similar to the  earlier R143s and later R179s, but the three car types cannot run together in the same train. The biggest difference between them is the Flexible Information and Notice Display (FIND) system on the R160s in place of static LED maps on the R143s and all A-Division New Technology fleet.\nIn total, 1,662 cars comprise the R160 class, which consists of two models, the 1,002 Alstom-built R160A cars and the 660 Kawasaki-built R160B cars. The R160A cars are organized in two different configurations, with 372 R160 cars arranged in four-car sets and 630 R160A cars are arranged in five-car sets. All R160B cars are in five-car sets, but are subdivided by which propulsion system they use; the majority use the Alstom ONIX propulsion system that are found on the R160A cars, while the rest use Siemens SITRAC propulsion.\nKawasaki had little to no problems in delivering the R160B cars, which entered service on August 17, 2006. Alstom was behind the delivery schedule early on for the R160As, which first ran on October 17, 2006. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority exercised options for both contracts, and by June 2010, all R160 cars were in service. Numerous experimental features were added to the R160s through the 2010s. 64 R160A cars were fitted with communications-based train control (CBTC) equipment installed for service on the Canarsie Line L, and the majority of the remaining fleet has CBTC equipment installed for service on the Queens Boulevard Line (E, F, M, and R trains).\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThere are two versions of the R160: the R160A (built by Alstom, numbered 8313\u20138712, 9233\u20139802, & 9943\u20139974) and R160B (built by Kawasaki, numbered 8713\u20139232 & 9803\u20139942). The two-car types are nearly identical to each other, and differ only in a few ways; they are interoperable and can be interchanged with each other. The R160As and the majority of the R160Bs utilize the same traction motors as the R142s, which are somewhat similar to the traction motors of the Alstom Metropolis 98B trains that are found on the Warsaw Metro. The rest of the R160Bs utilize traction motors similar to the ones that were tested on R143s 8205\u20138212.The R160 cars are configured in either four-car sets or five-car sets. 372 R160A cars (8313\u20138652 & 9943\u20139974) are configured as four-car sets. All are maintained at East New York Yard for the BMT Eastern Division (J/Z, L, and M). The remaining 630 R160A cars and all R160Bs are configured as five-car sets, maintained at Jamaica Yard, and operate on the E, F, G and R.\nThe R160A base order was part of a $961,687,121 contract funded in part by a grant from the Federal Transit Administration. The primary base order of the R160 class consisted of 660 cars, 400 R160As to be built by Alstom, and the remaining 260 R160Bs to be built by Kawasaki. The contract included options for further orders, which, if exercised, would have brought the total business with NYCT to about US$2.4 billion, for 1,700 subway cars, and Kawasaki would have manufactured 40% (680 cars) of the 1,700 cars. The R160 fleet was purchased at an average cost of $2.0 million USD per car.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\nThe R160s are very similar to the R143s and R179s; however, these car types are not interoperable with each other due to technical differences between the three.The R160s are equipped with regenerative braking, which allows the cars to capture the braking energy as trains enter a station and transfer it to trains on nearby tracks.One of the major changes and highlights of the new cars is the addition of an electronic \"

"Torbay_Inlet| Estuaries of Western Australia| Great Southern (Western Australia)| South coast of Western Australia| Western Australia geography stubs| ","Torbay Inlet is an estuarine inlet in the Great Southern region of Western Australia situated approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) east of the town of Denmark, Western Australia.\nTorbay Inlet is a wave-dominated estuary that functions primarily as a result of wave energy. The estuary has been severely modified as most of the natural catchment cover has been cleared. \nCovering a total surface area of 3.1 square kilometres (1 sq mi), 2.1 square kilometres (1 sq mi) of this is the central basin with the remainder being composed of saltmarsh and tidal delta. The lagoon is quite shallow and fringed with sedges and paperbarks.\nThe inlet outflows into the Southern Ocean and is part of the Torbay Inlet and Lake Powell Catchment Area.\nMuch of the land surrounding the inlet has an elevation of less than 1 metre (3 ft) so that under certain tidal and wind conditions the land is inundated with sea water that floods back up the estuary. As a result, in 1912, a barrage with floodgates was constructed to prevent this, but this proved to be unsuccessful.\nA sandbar exists across the mouth of the estuary for most of the year, but it is often breached following significant rain events.\nTrekkers on the Bibbulmun Track use the either the sandbar to cross the inlet or an alternative route using the Lower Denmark Road to go around the inlet.\n\n\n== Catchment ==\nThe catchment area is one of the most altered on the South Coast. The inlet drains a large swampland area that includes Lake Powell, Lake Manarup, Five Mile Swamp, Seven Mile Swamp and Marbelup Brook along with a number of man-made agricultural drains.\nThe area of the catchment is 330 square kilometres (127 sq mi) of which 55% has been cleared and contains 244 kilometres (152 mi) of water ways.Some swampland in the lower catchment was drained to open land for agriculture. Unfortunately this exposed pyrite in the soil that oxidised in the open air rendering the soil acid and infertile.\n\n\n== Watershed Torbay ==\nWatershed Torbay was a four-year project which planned and implemented a restoration plan for the Torbay Catchment. The Torbay catchment Group is the community group that formed in 1999 to implement the restoration plan. The activities of the group include establishing and repairing fencing around the waterway, Watsonia control and Wetland construction for nutrient stripping.\n\n\n== References =="
"Pornographic_film_actor| Pornographic film actors| Entertainment occupations| Pornography| ","A pornographic film actor or actress, adult entertainer, or porn star is a person who performs sex acts in video that is usually characterized as a pornographic movie. Such videos tend to be made in a number of distinct pornographic subgenres and attempt to present a sexual fantasy; the actors selected for a particular role are primarily selected on their ability to create or fit that fantasy. Pornographic videos are characterised as either softcore, which does not contain depictions of sexual penetration or extreme fetishism, and hardcore, which can contain depictions of penetration or extreme fetishism, or both. The genres and sexual intensity of videos is mainly determined by demand. Depending on the genre of the film, the on-screen appearance, age, and physical features of the main actors and their ability to create the sexual mood of the video is of critical importance. Most actors specialize in certain genres, such as straight sex, bisexual sex, gay sex, lesbian sex, bondage, strap-on sex, anal sex, double penetration, semen swallowing, teenage women, orgy sex, age roleplay sex, fauxcest sex, interracial or MILFs and much more.\nThe pornography industry in the United States was the first to develop its own movie star system, primarily for commercial reasons.

"Battle_of_Al_Wajbah| Conflicts in 1893| 1893 in Qatar| Battles involving Qatar| Wars involving the Ottoman Empire| Ottoman period in Qatar| ","The Battle of Al Wajbah was an armed conflict that took place in March 1893 in Qatar, a province of the Ottoman Empire's Najd sanjak at that time. The conflict was initiated after Ottoman officials imprisoned 16 Qatari tribal leaders and ordered a column of troops to march toward the Al Thani stronghold in the village of Al Wajbah in response to kaymakam Jassim Al Thani's refusal to come to Ottoman authority.The main battle took place in Al Wajbah Fort. After the Ottomans' unsuccessful attempt at seizing the fort, they retreated first to Shebaka Fort, and then to their fort in Al Bidda. Shortly after, Al Thani's troop besieged the fortress and cut off the water supply of the neighborhood, resulting in the concession of defeat by the Ottomans. Following this was an agreement to relinquish the Qatari captives in return for the safe passage of Mehmed Pasha's cavalry to Hofuf by land.Although Qatar did not gain full independence from the Ottoman Empire, the result of the battle is seen by Qatar as a defining moment in the establishment of Qatar as a modern state and the Ottoman's rule was over in Qatar.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDespite the disapproval of local tribes, Al Thani continued supporting Ottoman rule. However,  Qatari-Ottoman relations soon stagnated, and in 1882 they suffered further setbacks when the Ottomans refused to aid Al Thani in his expedition of Abu Dhabi-occupied Khawr al Udayd. Al Thani fell out of favour with the Ottomans after they received complaints from Qataris regarding his oppressions from 1885 to 1886. In a further blow to bilateral relations, the Ottomans supported the Ottoman subject Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab who attempted to supplant Al Thani as kaymakam of Qatar in 1888.In 1890, the Ottomans attempted to further consolidate their influence over Qatar by imposing numerous administrative reforms, increasing taxes and stationing additional troops in their garrison at Al Bidda. This eventually led Al Thani to rebel against the Ottomans, who he believed were seeking to usurp control of the peninsula. He resigned as kaymakam and stopped paying taxes in August 1892.\n\n\n== Chronology ==\n\n\n=== Negotiations ===\nIn October 1892, an Ottoman army comprising approximately 200 men led by the governor of Basra, Mehmed Hafiz Pasha, was sent to Qatar in response to Al Thani's transgressions. They arrived in February 1893, with further reinforcements en route from Kuwait. Al Thani, fearing that he would face death or imprisonment, fled first to Al Daayen, and then to Al Wajbah Fort (10 miles west of Doha) where he was accompanied by several Qatari tribes.Mehmed sent a letter to Al Thani demanding that he disband his troops and pledge loyalty to the Ottomans. However, Al Thani remained adamant in his refusal to comply with Ottoman authority, and, additionally, refused to meet with Mehmed himself on the basis of ill health. Instead, he appointed his brother, Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Thani, as his emissary. In March, after a month of back-and-forth parleying, Mehmed lost patience and imprisoned Al Thani's brother and between 13 and 16 prominent Qatari tribal leaders on the Ottoman corvette Merrikh. He also blockaded the village of Al Wajbah.Al Thani offered to pay a fee of ten thousand liras in return for the captives' release, but Mehmed declined his offer.\n\n\n=== Battle ===\nAfter declining Sheikh Jassim Al Thani's offer, Mehmed ordered a column of troops to advance towards Al Wajbah Fort under the command of general Yusuf Effendi. Shortly after Effendi's troops arrived at Al Wajbah, they came under heavy gunfire from Qatari infantry and cavalry troops, which totalled 3,000 to 4,000 men. After seven hours of exchange of gunfire, the Ottomans retreated to Shebaka fortress, where they sustained further casualties from a Qatari incursion. The Ottomans also lost contact with their incoming reinforcements from Kuwait, as their messages had been intercepted by Qatari Bedouins.The Ottoman troops retreated for a third time, to their fortress in Al Bidda, where their corvette was stationed. They proceeded to fire indiscriminately at the townspeople, killing a number of civilians. Shortly after, Al Thani's advancing column besieged the fortress and cut off the water supply of the neighbourhood. Without water and lacking in supplies, the Ottomans conceded defeat and agreed to relinquish the Qatari captives in return for the safe passage of Mehmed's cavalry to Hofuf by land.A report by the British government published one year after the battle states the following:\n\n\"

"QuickTime_Graphics| QuickTime| Lossy compression algorithms| Video codecs| ","QuickTime Graphics is a lossy video compression and decompression algorithm (codec) developed by Apple Inc. and first released as part of QuickTime 1.x in the early 1990s. The codec is also known by the name Apple Graphics and its FourCC SMC. The codec operates on 8-bit palettized RGB data. The bit-stream format of QuickTime Graphics has been reverse-engineered and a decoder has been implemented in the projects XAnim and libavcodec.\n\n\n== Technical Details ==\nThe input video that the codec operates on is in an 8-bit palettized RGB colorspace. Compression is achieved by conditional replenishment and by reducing the palette from 256 colors to a per-4\u00d74 block adaptive palette of 1-16 colors. Because Apple Video operates in the image domain without motion compensation, decoding is much faster than MPEG-style codecs which use motion compensation and perform coding in a transform domain. As a tradeoff, the compression performance of Apple Graphics is lower. The decoding complexity is approximately 50% that of the QuickTime Animation codec.Each frame is segmented into 4\u00d74 blocks in raster-scan order. Each block can be coded in one of the following coding modes: skip mode, single color, 2-, 4-, and 8 color palette modes, two repeat modes, and PCM.\n\n\n=== Skip mode ===\nThe skip mode realizes conditional replenishment. If a block is coded in skip mode, the content of the block at same location in the previous frame is copied to the current frame. Runs of skip blocks are coded in a run-length encoding scheme, enabling a high compression ratio in static areas of the picture.\n\n\n=== Single color ===\nIn single color mode, the entire 4\u00d74 block is painted with a single color. This mode can also be considered as a 1-color palette mode.\n\n\n=== Palette  (2, 4, or 8-color) modes ===\nIn the palette modes, each 4\u00d74 block is coded with a 2, 4, or 8-color palette. To select one of the colors from the palette, 1, 2, or 3 bits per pixel are used, respectively. The palette can be written to the bitstream either explicitly or as a reference to an entry in the palette cache. The palette cache is a set of three circular buffers which store the 256 most recently used palettes, one each for of the 2, 4, and 8-color modes.Interpreted as vector quantization, three-dimensional vectors with components red, green, and blue are quantized using a forward adaptive codebook with between 1 and 8 entries.\n\n\n=== Repeat modes ===\nThere are two different repeat modes. In the single block repeat mode, the previous block is repeated a specified number of times. In the two block repeat mode, the previous two blocks are repeated a specified number of times.\n\n\n=== PCM (16 color) mode ===\nIn 16-color mode, the color of each pixel in a block is explicitly written to the bit-stream. This mode is lossless and equivalent to raw PCM without any compression.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIndexed color\nColor quantization\nBlock truncation coding, a similar coding technique for grayscale content\nColor Cell Compression, a similar coding technique for color content, based on block truncation coding\nApple Video, a codec based on a similar design\nMicrosoft Video 1, a codec based on a similar design\nSmacker video, a codec based on a similar design\nS3 Texture Compression, a texture compression format based on a similar design\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nQuickTime Graphics decoder - FFmpeg"

"Christianity_and_agriculture| Christianity and society| Agriculture in society| ","Christian doctrines, ideologies and beliefs have influenced the manner in which human interactions with land, soil, and plants are manifested, both as a historical interplay between Christianity and land, and more contemporary movements where diverse sets of biblical readings, theological interpretations and Christian ethics are manifested in Christian approaches to food production.\n\n\n== Christian stewardship: dominion and responsibility ==\nAgriculture and Christianity are two important features that have influenced the development of societies in Europe, the Americas and beyond. With the Bible situated in an agricultural context, biblical narratives have produced interpretations and positions that guide Christians' claims to, care for and use of land. One of the most prominent biblical themes in relation to the use of natural resources and land has been stewardship, which on a general and basic level implies responsible management of resources. Alongside Christian ethics of eco-justice and creation spirituality, stewardship ethics draw on the creation narrative in Genesis, where the role of humans as the high-ranking servants, the stewards, are given authority over God\u2019s creation (Genesis 1:27\u201328, Genesis 2:15). The notion of Christian stewardship has not been univocal, but includes power and authority as well as humility and responsibility, features which have influenced different interpretations. Among Protestant denominations in North America, stewardship has often implied responsibility for financial resources that include tithing and maintaining congregational and mission work, while other Christians have seen stewardship in relation to natural resources and, increasingly, environmental concerns.The latter contains two basic features: (1) stewardship as dominion over nature; and (2) stewardship as responsibility for maintaining the planet and protecting God\u2019s creation. While both positions draw on a Christian anthropocentric worldview, dominion stewardship centers on the idea that interaction with nature should primarily enhance human life. In the context of modern industrialization, this has implied promoting human control as the exploitation of natural resources in the service of humanity. This legitimization of humankind's use and exploitation of natural resources has led to critique of Christianity\u2019s role in shaping an growing ecological crisis. In contrast, alternative Christian stewardship positions have interpreted humans' elevated role as answerable to caring for God's creation in an ecologically sustainable way, which today also implies reversal of humanity\u2019s negative impact on the world\u2019s ecosystems. This makes stewardship a vocation engaged in the well-being of the material world, that sees environmental responsibility as part of a work towards social justice, human-nature relations and peace more broadly. \n\n\n== Monastic gardens and agriculture ==\nWhile monastic rules tell little about how monks and nuns were to support themselves, it is likely that in the deserts of Egypt, on the islands of Greece and of the coast of Ireland, the first Christian monks and hermits depended on forms of gardening, gathering and fishing. Since the mid-sixth century and onward, Christian monasteries in Europe and the Middle East also developed agricultural practices to remain self-contained and avoid contact with the outer world. Through the middle ages, the land that monastic communities monitored however followed the tides of the rest of feudal Europe. Monastic orders took on management roles and cultivated land through the use of labor tenants. This approach slowly changed the 11th century when monastic orders such as the Cistercians advocated a return to a simpler way of living and that monks and nuns return to work the land themselves rather than serve as overseers. This developed new forms of monastic farming that emerged in the 12th century.  While these changes were born to keep Benedictine, Cistercian, Franciscan and later Jesuit monks from being contaminated by worldly matters and political schemes, it made monasteries into hubs where agriculture and gardening practices thrived. Under St Bernard, St Francis and Alan of Lille, monastic communities' return to agricultural manual labor became interpreted as modes of turning wilderness (chaos) into paradise (order). These patterns came to influence agricultural ideas and values not just in the western context but also across the world when monastic orders spread through migration, mission and western imperial expansion. The relationship between work, Christianity and agriculture was also prominent in Protestant pietistic movements\u2019 struggle for religious freedom, autonomy and self-reliance in Europe during the 1600 and 1700s. This context forced some Protestant groups to leave Europe for North America. For many of these, agriculture served as a prominent feature in the relocation on the new continent (e.g. Mennonite Christians).\n\n\n== Christian missions, colonialism and farming ==\nIn the western colonial expansions globally from the 1500s onward, Christian mission and agriculture served as central features when \u201cnewly discovered\u201d areas were seized under the control of new empires. Especially in British imperialism, the construction of enclosed gardens served as means of domesticating lands under new rule. Agricultural practices role in transforming \u201cthe wild\u201d into habitable places were prevalent in (western) Christian traditions and followed Christian missionaries.  Alongside education and medicine, agriculture helped spread western power and influence through Christian missions.\n\n\n=== Africa ===\nIn African contexts, western missionaries often saw Christian evangelization as connected to economic development and new ways of social organization. The Scottish explorer and missionary David Livingstone for instance saw the aim of missionary societies in Africa to be the spread of the three Cs; \u201cChristianity, Commerce and Civilization.\u201d From the 1800s onward, Christian missions across Africa did not just preach the gospel but were heavily engaged in promoting new ways of living through education and medical work. The rationale behind this approach was the belief in that by teaching Africans practical, technological and commercial skills, African societies could develop into more self-sufficient and \u201ccivilized\u201d entities. This would also practically facilitate settings where a Christian lifestyle could be fully lived out. Connected to these ideas, the promotion of industrial missions generated a wide range of training seminars and education as a means to generate progress and African industrialization. The Zambezi Industrial Mission in present day Malawi, the Basel Mission in Ghana and Protestant missions in Nigeria were all places where Christian teachings merged with education in agriculture to promote large-scale production of new cash crops such as cocoa, coffee and tea. The local perception of new agricultural practices and technological innovations introduced by Christian missionaries differed across Africa and ranged between accommodation and rejection. In South Africa, African chiefs often valued these new skills and technical tools. Local adaptation generated new means of production that came to alter traditional farming practices and social relations in producing food. The introduction of the plough, for instance, created economic incentives that drew men into agricultural domains that previously had been connected to subsistence farming and were the responsibility of women.\n\n\n=== Contemporary mission ===\nEven though Christian missions work has over the last century changed dramatically in outlook, the message of the gospel remains an important feature for Christian missions across the globe, especially through commitment to development work that enhances people\u2019s livelihood. In the wider context of an emerging ecological crisis and climate change, food security, environmental care, sustainable living and farming have remained important features in how Christian communities and churches work with questions of poverty, development and social justice. This \u201cgreening\u201d of Christianity has produced renewed focus on Christian practical engagement with nature, soil and land, as well as the work of cultivating food.\n\n\n== Contemporary Christian approaches to farming ==\nPresent-day modes of Christian farming are situated in a wider context of faith-based development work, religious agrarianism and environmental ethics and so address humans\u2019 use of land and natural resources following modernity, industrialization and the agricultural green revolution since the 1950s. It reflects a general \u201cgreening\u201d trend within Christianity globally where questions on Christians\u2019 responsibility for addressing environmental concerns form part of Christian theological and ethical discourse. Pope Francis' encyclical Laudatio Si from 2015, which builds on the model of St Francis of Assisi and the environmental teachings of John Paul II, is one example. Others are the environmental work of the World Council of Churches, and a range of faith-based development organs and organizations within Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant traditions. Part of the greening of Christianity is also a wider body of eco-theological and ecofeminist scholarly work that address Christianity's past, present and future relationships to nature.Approaches to Christian farming have also been highly influenced by North American lay Christian farmers, Christian theologians, and agrarian thinkers such as Wendell Berry, Wes Jackson, Thomas Berry and D.J. Hall. Since the 1970s, this has generated a new Christian ethic of farming under the framework of religious agrarianism. In practical terms, Christian agrarianism should regenerate rather than degenerate the environment and God\u2019s creation. Religious agrarian thinkers unite in their critique of the industrial, mechanized and reductive agriculture of the green revolution and its impact on rural farming communities locally as well as globally. They oppose industrial farms' use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Instead, organic, hand-driven farming is stressed in light of social justice, health and relation to place in holistic terms. Such approaches have influenced North American Christian farmers ranging from Joel Salatin at the Polyface farms to the Roman Catholic Sister Miriam Macgillis at the Genesis farm. United in Christian agrarian ethics of sustainability and care for creation, this translates into biodynamic, organic and communal shared features of cultivating food that also include Christian applications of permaculture and regenerative agricultural designs. It also features communitarian living, communal teaching and work, and trends connected to new monasticism, that place religious values in conversation with wider secular environmental ethics.Present-day Christian farming is also present in relation to agricultural development, questions of food security and poverty. It overlaps with religious agrarianism but is primarily present in the global south. One example goes under the name of \u201cFarming God\u2019s Way\u201d which today is present through a wide variety of networks and Christian communities in over 20 countries in Africa as well as in Mexico, Bangladesh, Cambodia and the US. Farming God\u2019s Way is considered one of the most extensive \u201ctheologically-shaped farming narrative\u201d globally and have been part of the work of the Alliance of Religions and Conservation funded by Prince Philip (closed since 2019). Farming God\u2019s Way combines biblical readings with agricultural techniques also known as conservation agriculture, in which methods of not disturbing the soil (no-tilling), crop-rotation and the application of mulch cover are promoted as ways of mitigating climate change and environmental stress on depleted soils while at the same time increase productivity.Faith-based farming methods such as Farming God\u2019s Way have received critique from researchers within agrarian development for not considering local and contextual circumstances, but instead presenting it as a one size fits all model based on divine principles. The presence of Christian actors in creating sustainable farming models has also been analyzed from a value-based approach, though the impact of faith on agricultural development has been contested by program managers because of the mindset change it creates.\n\n\n== See also ==\nReligion and agriculture\n\n\n== References =="

It follows the stories of the 30 women who undertook the Long March as part of the Chinese Red Army in 1934. While only 10,000 of the original 86,000 soldiers survived the 4,000 mile trek, all 30 women survived. To research the project, King interviewed the last surviving woman who marched with the First Army, and delved into historical accounts previously untranslated into English. As with his previous book, the nonfiction national bestseller Skeletons on the Zahara, he also traversed one of the most dangerous portions of the journey on foot, trekking in the Snowy Mountains and on the high-altitude bogs of western Sichuan Province (the deadliest part of the Long March).

"Dipropyltryptamine| Drugs not assigned an ATC code| Entheogens| Psychedelic tryptamines| Designer drugs| Serotonin receptor agonists| ","N,N-Dipropyltryptamine (DPT) is a psychedelic entheogen belonging to the tryptamine family. Use as a designer drug has been documented by law enforcement officials since as early as 1968. However, potential therapeutic use was not investigated until the 1970s.  It is found either as a crystalline hydrochloride salt or as an oily or crystalline base. It has not been found to occur endogenously. It is a close structural homologue of dimethyltryptamine and diethyltryptamine.\n\nFrequent physical effects are nausea, numbness of the tongue or throat, and pupil dilation.\n\n\n== Pharmacology ==\nStudies on rodents have found that the effectiveness with which a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist blocks the behavioral actions of this compound strongly suggest that the 5-HT2A receptor is an important site of action for DPT, but the modulatory actions of a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist also imply a 5-HT1A-mediated component to the actions of DPT.\n\n\n== Chemistry ==\nDPT changes Ehrlich's reagent violet and causes the marquis reagent to turn yellow.\n\n\n== Psychedelic properties ==\nWhile dipropyltryptamine is chemically similar to dimethyltryptamine (DMT), its psychoactive effects are markedly different.While experiences of apparent entity contact may occasionally occur under the influence of DPT, the perspective is more as an observer or watcher, as contrasted to the more personal and realistic experience reported with DMT.\n\n\n== Side effects ==\nNegative side effects of human consumption of this drug can include increased heart rate, dizziness, anxiety, confusion, paranoia, seizure and nausea.

"William_J._Lennarz| 1934 births| Living people| American biochemists| University of Illinois alumni| Stony Brook University faculty| Eberly College of Science alumni| ","William Joseph Lennarz (May, 1934 \u2013 October 27, 2021) was a biochemist at Stony Brook University. He was born in May 1934 in New York City. Before Lennarz began his tenure at Stony Brook, he studied chemistry and organic chemistry. After working as a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard, he developed an interest in biochemistry. He has focused the majority of his research on biochemical processes in cells.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWilliam J. Lennarz was a biochemist at Stony Brook University. Lennarz began his academic career at Penn State University as a chemical engineering major, but eventually changed his course of study to chemistry. After graduating from Penn State, Lennarz attended the University of Illinois to pursue a graduate degree in organic chemistry. While attending the University of Illinois, Lennarz researched the use of boronic acids as a potential cancer treatment. When a beam of neutrons is applied to boron, it is capable of emitting alpha particles that have the ability to kill cells. With this property in mind, Lennarz attempted to incorporate boronic acids into cancer cells to create a mechanism to selectively destroy tumor cells. While in graduate school, Lennarz developed an interest in biochemistry that lead him to pursue postdoc work under Konrad Bloch at Harvard. At Harvard, Lennarz worked on research pertaining to the biosynthesis of fatty acids in yeast. Through his work at Harvard, he was able to play a role in discovering acyl carrier protein, which is an enzyme in the fatty acid biosynthesis cycle. After leaving Harvard, Lennarz was employed at Johns Hopkins and the University of Texas Cancer Center before arriving at Stony Brook. Lennarz had over two hundred publications,  roughly half of them coming after his arrival at Stony Brook in 1989. His lab focused mostly on studying glycoprotein synthesis.\n\n\n== Notable work ==\n\n\n=== Early work ===\nBefore his tenure at Stony Brook, Lennarz was involved in some notable studies. Along with Luis Leloir, Robert Spiro, Edward Heath, Lennarz was able to determine the mechanism by which N-linked oligosaccharides are added to proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Lennarz and his lab mates discovered that these sugars are transferred as a group, and are synthesized from a dolichol-linked oligosaccharide with a conserved structure. They found the precursor for these molecules had the structure (Man)nGlcNAcB1,4 \u2192GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol, and each precursor had at least five mannose residues.  Additionally, they discovered that precursor molecules contain one to two glucose molecules, which was a surprising find. Up until this point, all N-linked oligosaccharides that had been characterized lacked glucose molecules. This lead the group to postulate that the oligosaccharide component of the precursor was modified by glycosidase enzymes before the glycoprotein could be considered mature. This work was very important in laying the foundation for later research that described the mechanism for the complete assembly glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\n\n=== Recent work ===\nIn 2006, Lennarz and several colleagues published a study on the peptide N-glycanase (PNGase). This protein helps in the process of misfolded glycoprotein degradation by removing oligosaccharide chains from the proteins. Lennarz and colleagues used the mouse PNGase Png1P to study the interaction of this protein with the proteasome. GST fusion proteins of each protein being observed in the study were produced in E. coli in order to reliably purify each protein.  The study found that in vitro, the mouse PNGase interacted directly with the proteins mHR23B and ms4. It was previously believed that ATP was a requirement for PNGases to interact with the proteasome, but this study found that this was not the case. Through this study, Lennarz and his team were also able to determine which region of the mouse PNGase was responsible for binding to ms4. It was found that the N-terminus of the PNGase was essential in binding to ms4. Compared to yeast PNGase proteins, which had been previously  studied at the time of this experiment, mice PNGase proteins have an extended N-terminus that contains a PUB domain. By truncating PNGase amino acids 1-171 (which compose the N-terminus), Lennarz and his team found this additional domain was not sufficient to bind ms4 by itself, indicating that the entirety of the N-terminus is required for proper binding. The C-terminal domain, which was found to bind mHR23B, was also analyzed by Lennarz and his team. They discovered that binding to mHR23B is likely what activates the C-terminal catalytic domain of PNGase. Binding of these two proteins was also found to govern the interaction between mHR23B and p97, another protein involved in the proteasome degradation pathway. The two binding proteins were also found to compete with each other to bind the PNGase, and a complex of all three proteins was found to be unable to form.Another notable study by Lennarz sought to determine the location at which oligosaccharyltransferase (OT) binds the ribosome. This enzyme is responsible for transferring high mannose oligosaccharides to polypeptides translocating into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The study used purified ribosomes and yeast oligosaccharyltransferase to conduct each experiment. It was found that OT binds the ribosome, and the Sec61 translocon complex binds the ribosome as well to form a complex to glycosylate N-linked oligosaccharides on proteins translocating into the endoplasmic reticulum. Additionally, Lennarz and his team showed that OT binds the 60S subunit of 80S yeast ribosomes in a 1:1 molar ratio through chemical cross-linking experiments. The protein was found to specifically bind to the location on the ribosome where the translocating polypeptide exits, which is supported by its enzymatic function.More recently, Lennarz was involved in the study of the structure of the Sec63 translocon complex, which is involved in translocating pre-synthesized polypeptides from the cytosol to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Using cryo-electron microscopy, the heptameric structure of the complex was able to be visualized in greater detail. The complex was found to have a mass of 287 kilodaltons, as was found to be composed of three subcomplexes. The complex was found to be composed of a Sec61-Sbh1-Sss1 translocon complex, a heterotetramer composed of Sec62-Sec63-Sec71-Sec72, and a trimer composed of Sec63-Sec71-Sec72. During their assessment of the study of this complex, Lennarz and his team also found that positively charged amino acids in the Sec61 component of the complex were responsible for mediating the formation of the complex. These amino acids were found to inhibit the formation of the Sec63 translocon complex.\n\n\n== References =="

"Eye-cup| Ancient Greek pot shapes| ","Eye-cup is the term describing a specific cup type in ancient Greek pottery, distinguished by pairs of eyes painted on the external surface. \n\n\n== Description ==\nClassified as kylikes in terms of shape, eye-cups were especially widespread in Athens and Chalkis in the second half of the sixth century BC. The bowl of the eye-cup rests on a short squat foot; both sides are dominated by large painted pairs of eyes under arched eyebrows. The eyeballs are painted in silhouette style, later often filled with white paint or painted white on black. Some eyes are \u201cfemale\u201d, i.e. almond-shaped and without tear-ducts. Often, a stylized nose is placed centrally between the eyes. \nWhile used as a drinking vessel, due to the necessary inclination of the vessel, the cup with its painted eyes, the handles looking like ears and the base of the foot like a mouth, would have resembled a mask. Many of the vases also bear dionysiac imagery. The eyes are assumed to have served an apotropaic (evil-averting) function.\n\n\n== Types ==\nEye-cups were painted by various painters, mostly in the black-figure style, but later also in the red-figure style. The earliest bilingually painted vases, those with both styles, include specimens of eye-cups with a black-figure interior and a red-figure exterior. \nThe introduction of this bilingual type and its specific decoration into Attic vase painting is attributed to Exekias. His eye-cup in Munich, dated 530\u2013540 BC, is considered a masterpiece of the type. It depicts Dionysos, lying in a symposiast posture on a ship. His divine nature is indicated by his attributem, a vine, growing from the mast.\n\n\n== Painters or groups ==\nOther well-known examples of eye-cups are by the following painters or groups:\n\nAmasis Painter; he painted several eye-cups of a variant shape with non-carinated profile (Type B)\nAndokides\nAntiphon Painter\nEpiktetos: bilingual eye-cups\nGhost Painter\nPainter of Nicosia Olpe\nHischylos\nKrokotos Group\nLeafless Group; they continued the basic eye-cup shape with later variants, often lacking the large pair of eyes\nLydos Group\nLysippides Painter\nMastos Painter\nNikosthenes\nOltos: bilinguals\nPheidippos: bilinguals\nSkythes: bilinguals\nGroup of Walters 48.42, specialising in frontal views of masks of Dionysos, and of satyrs and maenads between the eyes, and gorgoneia on the cup interiorA special type is the Chalkidian style of cup, of which further variants exist.\n\n\n== History ==\nDating is often difficult, but the majority of eye-cups were probably produced between 540 and 500 BC, perhaps up to 480 BC. \nThey were also exported to Italy in large quantities. The majority of vases of this type were found as grave goods in Etruscan chamber tombs.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCorpus vasorum antiquorum. Deutschland. Hrsg. Komm. f. d.

During the 1980s, he served in the government of Congo-Brazzaville as Minister of Information and as Minister of Secondary and Higher Education. Later, during the 1990s, he was Congo-Brazzaville's Permanent Representative to the United Nations.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nAbibi obtained his doctorate in mathematics in 1970 from the University of Grenoble in France. He was amongst the first Central Africans to receive doctoral degrees in Mathematics. Abibi was one of the Northern political activists educated in France that ensured support for Marien Ngouabi in the Congolese Students Association (AEC) in 1972. The rapprochement between AEC and the regime was, however, fiercely rejected by cadres of the Congolese Party of Labour (PCT). The PCT cadres kidnapped Abibi, forcing Ngouabi to order his release.Politically, Abibi espoused a Marxist ideological line that was heavily influenced by radical African nationalism. He served as rector of the Marien Ngouabi University. Becoming a confidant of Denis Sassou Nguesso (espousing an ideological line to the liking of Sassou) Abibi was named Minister of Information, Posts and Telecommunications in 1983, replacing captain Florent Ntsiba. In 1984 Abibi was included in the Central Committee of the PCT. He was put in-charge of the international relations of the party. Also in 1984, he was moved from his post as Minister of Information to the post of Minister of Secondary and Higher Education. He lost his cabinet seat in a December 1986 reshuffle.Abibi chaired the Congolese Anti-Apartheid Committee, and in 1989 he was named chairman of the African Anti-Apartheid Committee. Also in 1989, he was included in the PCT Politburo and assigned responsibility for education, ideology, and political and civic training.In the 1990s he joined the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy of Pascal Lissouba. He also served as Permanent Representative of the Congo to the United Nations during this decade.Following the June\u2013October 1997 civil war, in which Lissouba was ousted and Sassou Nguesso returned to power, Abibi was absent from Congolese politics for years. Eventually, however, he rejoined Sassou Nguesso's party, the PCT. In October 2011, he was elected to the Senate of Congo-Brazzaville as a PCT candidate in Sangha Department. In the indirect Senate election, he received 61 votes from the electors in Sangha, 87.14% of the total; this placed Abibi in a three-way tie for first place and secured him one of the six available seats for Sangha.\n\n\n== References =="

An opportunity to escape the life of a rural labourer presented itself when Beno\u00eet was admitted to a seminary school in Lyon. However, instead of becoming a priest, Malon became interested in radical politics through the writings of P.-J. Proudhon. In 1863 he left the seminary and moved to Paris, where he worked in a factory as a dyer. He became a friend of Z\u00e9phyrin Cam\u00e9linat. Cam\u00e9linat was a friend of Proudhon and a collaborator of Charles Longuet, Karl Marx' son-in-law. Through Cam\u00e9linat and Longuet, Malon became involved in the French section of the First International, which he joined in 1865. In the factional struggles within the International, Malon sided with the 'anti-authoritarian' followers of Proudhon and Bakunin, against the Marxists. Malon was active in organising factory workers and led several strikes. In 1868 and 1870, Malon was among the defendants in the sedition trials of the French Section of the International. He was sentenced to prison both times.\nWith the fall of Napol\u00e9on III in 1870, Malon was freed from prison and helped organise relief for the poor during the Prussian siege of Paris. He joined the 'Republican Central Committee', which united Proudhonists with followers of Auguste Blanqui. In 1871 Malon was elected to the National Assembly of the new Third Republic, but he resigned in protest against the peace treaty, which ceded Alsace-Lorraine to Prussia.\nWhen the Paris Commune rose against the Thiers government at Versailles, Malon was elected to the Council of the Commune. He also served on the Committee on Labour and Trade. Malon opposed the Jacobin faction in the Commune, associated with F\u00e9lix Pyat. Malon voted against the creation of a new Committee of Public Safety. He was horrified by the 'bloody week' when several hostages were shot. After the suppression of the Commune he escaped to Lugano, Switzerland, where he joined the Jura Federation, dominated by Bakuninists.\nAround this time, Malon began a romantic relationship with L\u00e9odile Champseix (better known under her literary pseudonym Andr\u00e9 L\u00e9o), an author and feminist. They entered a 'free marriage' in 1872.\nA general amnesty in 1880 enabled Malon to return to France, where he resumed work as a journalist and became involved in the new French Workers' Party (POF) of Jules Guesde. In 1882, the party split between 'orthodox' Marxists around Guesde and reformist 'possibilists' led by Paul Brousse. Malon sided with Brousse and helped organise the Federation of the Socialist Workers of France (FTSF).\nIn 1885, Malon founded the journal Revue Socialiste. Despite his affiliation with the Possibilists, Malon considered himself an independent socialist and called for the re-unification of the socialist movement (which he did not live to see). The Revue Socialiste opened its pages to all tendencies of French socialism. In 1889, he became editor of the newspaper Egalit\u00e9. He also published several books, including a work on 'social economy' (1883), a five-volume history of socialism and a work outlining his theory of 'integral socialism' (1891).\nWhen Malon died in 1893, his funeral at the P\u00e8re-Lachaise cemetery was attended by a crowd of over 10,000 mourners. In 1913, a monument to Malon was established, and Jean Jaur\u00e8s gave the dedication speech. In 1905, the various factions of French socialism united in the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO).\n\n\n== References ==\nVincent, K.

He was re-elected in the 1999 Northwest Territories general election, winning in a landslide with 83% of the vote.\nRoland was returned by acclamation in the 2003 Northwest Territories general election and acclaimed for a second time in the 2007 Northwest Territories general election, following which the members of the Legislature elected him Premier of the Northwest Territories on October 17, 2007.\nHis government survived a historic vote of no confidence on February 6, 2009 by a vote of 10 to 8, following allegations by a number of MLAs that he was refusing to communicate with them on major policy decisions, including changes to the territory's health benefits policy, a $34-million loan given to Discovery Air, approval of the $165-million Deh Cho Bridge, and plans to amalgamate a number of public services boards.He faced renewed controversy in May 2009 when the territorial conflict of interest commissioner, Gerald Gerrand, ruled that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the affair constituted a breach of Roland's duties of office, including not-yet-confirmed allegations that Russell passed on confidential information from legislative committee meetings to Roland.Roland unsuccessfully ran in the 2015 federal election and is formerly President of the Western Arctic Conservative Association.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n=== 2007 election ===\nIn this election, no other candidate registered to run for this riding, so Floyd Roland was returned by acclamation.\n\n\n=== 2003 election ===\nIn this election, no other candidate registered for this riding, so Floyd Roland was returned by acclamation.\n\n\n=== 1999 election ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFloyd Roland\n[1]"
"Lucien_G%C3%A9las| 1873 births| 1944 deaths| Composers for the classical guitar| French classical guitarists| French male guitarists| French luthiers| French classical composers| French male classical composers| ","Lucien G\u00e9las (1 January 1873 or 12 January 1873 \u2013 5 June 1944) was a luthier, classical guitarist, and teacher.\nG\u00e9las was born in Menton, Alpes Maritimes. He composed for solo guitar and as well as works for voice and guitar set to his own texts. G\u00e9las owned the complete historic works of Sor as published by Meissonnier (Paris 1820\u20131836) and Pacini (1830\u20131836). The works are now a part of the Spencer Collection at the Royal Academy of Music in London.\n\n\n== G\u00e9las Guitar (double-top guitar) ==\nG\u00e9las is well known for inventing and patenting a guitar design which uses a double top: It is often called a G\u00e9las guitar, or a double-top guitar (or double-resonance-guitar) and was common in the first half of the 20th century.\nG\u00e9las was awarded a gold medal at the Bordeaux Exhibition in 1907 and a gold medal at the Brussels Exhibition in 1910 for his double-top instruments.The two tops of the instruments have a resonating space between them. The inner top is not parallel to the outer one, such that the guitar can be observed to have a particular tilt. Also, the strings run through the bridge (which is on the inner top) and are attached at the bottom, in such a way that the plucked part of the string before the bridge is at an angle to the part of the string after the bridge. This is achieved by having the plucked part of the string slightly angled to the inner top (in conventional guitar it would be parallel), resulting in a raised tension in the inner top.\nThe patent was first filed in Paris in 1905; and the patent text is downloadable in French and English.His guitars were played by numerous important artists, particularly in the first half of the 20th century. Heinrich Albert (1870\u20131950) obtained a G\u00e9las guitar (from Gaudet in Paris) and ascribes his concert successes in a large part to the guitar, praising its carrying sound, ease of responsiveness, and tone-colour. Other players of G\u00e9las guitars included Luise Walker (1910\u20131998) and Bruno Henze (1900\u20131978).\nG\u00e9las produced the instruments with the help of guitar-makers (following his patent), at first Th\u00e9odore Gaudet and later Jean Rovi\u00e8s, Beuscher, Richard Jacob and others. The instruments included classical guitars, mandolins, jazz double-basses and Hawaiian guitars.\n\n\n== See also ==\nClassical guitar making\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nG\u00e9las Patent\nG\u00e9las instruments at the Cit\u00e9 de la musiqueG\u00e9las Guitars (Classical guitar)G\u00e9las guitar\nRestoration images of a G\u00e9las guitar\nG\u00e9las guitarG\u00e9las Guitars (Hawaiian guitar)G\u00e9las guitar\nG\u00e9las guitar (ref)G\u00e9las MandolinsG\u00e9las Mandolin\nG\u00e9las Mandolin"

Religious organizations and preachers have been vocal in their comments on the controversial legislation that seeks to establish a commission with the power to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the coup d'\u00e9tat which shook Fiji to its foundations in 2000.\nThe Methodist Church has endorsed the bill (with a faction dissenting), Hindu organizations have opposed it, as has the Roman Catholic Church and a number of other religious groups.  Several religious groups have taken more nuanced positions, calling for dialogue, negotiation, and good will.\n\n\n== The Methodist Church ==\nThe Methodist Church announced its support for the bill on 19 July, according to the Rev. Timoci Nawaciono, head of the church's Nasea circuit.  Methodist support was much coveted by the government, as almost two-thirds of indigenous Fijians are affiliated to the denomination.  Nawaciono acknowledged, however, that Methodist support for the legislation was far from unanimous, and said that on 24 July, all parishioners will be asked to complete forms stating their individual opinions on it.  On 1 August, the church announced that a majority of its members had voted in favour of the bill.\nOn 21 July, the Rev.

"Husum-Schwesing_concentration_camp| Subcamps of Neuengamme| 20th century in Schleswig-Holstein| Nordfriesland| 1930s architecture| ","The Husum-Schwesing subcamp (German: KZ-Au\u00dfenlager Husum-Schwesing) in the Schwesing district of Engelsburg, about five kilometres northeast of Husum, became a satellite of Neuengamme concentration camp on 26 September 1944 and was occupied by prisoners in connection with the construction of the so-called Frisian Wall (Friesenwall). Some 2,500 people from 14 countries were incarcerated here in autumn 1944; 297 prisoners died as a result of forced labour, malnutrition and abuse. The camp was closed on 29 December 1944.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe camp was sited a few kilometres northeast of Husum in the county of Nordfriesland between the main road from Husum to Flensburg (today the B 200) and the now disused railway line to Flensburg. The local name for this area was Engelsburg, which is why the name KZ Engelsburg is sometimes used.\n\n\n== Use as a construction work camp ==\nIn 1938/39 the Husum-Schwesing Airfield was laid out. A camp for the 231st Construction Battalion was built for the workers near the village of Schwesing. The camp's capacity was set at 250 men. The Luftwaffe stationed in Husum during the Second World War, however, only stationed aircraft dummies there to mislead Allied bomber units flying in from the North Sea. After the construction troops withdrew, the camp temporarily served as a collection point for soldiers of the Wehrmacht returning from leave bound for their units in Scandinavia. A temporary vacancy followed.\n\n\n== Concentration sub-camp ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nIn September 1944, the villagers of Husum were ordered to Schwesing to erect a double barbed wire fence around the camp and erect high watchtowers at the four corners.\nThe camp consisted of nine barracks, eight of which were used as prisoners' quarters and one as an infirmary. In addition, there were two larger buildings on the 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) site that housed the camp cookhouse, armoury, a tailor's and cobbler's, as well as four temporary latrines.\n\n\n=== Inmates ===\nOn 25 September, around 1,500 prisoners from Neuengamme concentration camp were transported to Husum-Schwesing in cattle wagons of the German Reichsbahn. On 20 October, another 1,000 prisoners from Neuengamme followed. Most of the prisoners were of Dutch, French, Danish and Polish nationality. Other prisoners came from countries like the Soviet Union and Germany. The camp elder was Reichsdeutsche political prisoner, Heinrich Neufeldt.\n\n\n=== Everyday camp life ===\nUsing only shovels and spades the prisoners had to dig a four to five metre wide and three metre deep anti-tank trench and construct battle positions and shelters in the heavy marshland. Sometimes they stood in cold water and mud all day long. In the process, they were exposed to the beatings of the kapos, who were supposed to force people to work, but often terrorized at random. Older marines \u201cunfit for field service\u201d guarded the prisoners at work and during the often kilometre-long march to get there.\nThe operation of the camp took place in view of the local population: on the way to the Atlantic Wall site, the prisoners were driven through the streets of Husum in the morning and in the evening. Husum residents had to transport their bodies to the cemetery in their cart. There are also local reports of seeing the prisoners through the camp fence and at work.\nIn December 1944, the Friesenwall had become completely pointless due to the changing military situation. The camp in Husum-Schwesing was closed and the surviving prisoners returned to Neuengamme.\n\n\n=== Camp command ===\n\nFrom September 1944, the Husum-Schwesing sub-camp was headed by SS-Untersturmf\u00fchrer, Hans Hermann Griem, who in November 1944 also took over the management of the Ladelund sub-camp. He constantly withheld food, enjoyed sadistic torture, shot several prisoners himself and was often drunk. After the camps were dissolved, Griem commanded the Dalum subcamp (Emslandlager Dalum).\n\n\n=== After 1945 ===\nAfter the end of the war, most of the dead were returned to their homeland. For a time, the site served as a refugee camp.\nIt was not until 1963 that the Public Prosecutor of Flensburg reopened the investigation against Griem, but did not make any progress. In 1965, the whereabouts of Griem could be determined. He had settled in Hamburg-Bergedorf. Thereupon the case was handed over to the Hamburg public prosecutor in 1966. This began with systematic investigations aimed at a lawsuit against Griem. On 16 January 1969, the Hamburg State Court opened preliminary judicial investigations against Griem. Shortly before the actual trial began, Griem died on 25 June 1971.\n\n\n== Concentration camp memorial ==\n\nIn 1983, the Husum-Schwesing concentration camp working group published the history of the camp and on 30 January 1983, a memorial event was attended by around a thousand people in Husum, at which former prisoners recounted their suffering in the camp. In 1985, the county of Nordfriesland was able to buy the eastern half of the former concentration camp site and, in 1994, further parts of the site, on which the remains of the foundations and the hydrant are located. A memorial designed by sculptor, Ulrich Lindow, was inaugurated on the camp grounds as early as November 1987. The site has been a listed building since 1995. A multilingual information board with information about the history of the camp was set up in 1998 next to the visitor car park. Since 2001/2002, 300 steles have been commemorated those killed in the camp. The steles symbolize stooped people in humble posture and their scattered distribution recalls the arbitrary violence against the prisoners. They are made of steel that rusts quickly, so that the names of the deceased are difficult to decipher - as an indication that the memory of the time and the crimes of National Socialism is difficult to maintain.\nIn 2017 the \u201cHouse of the Present\u201d was built. In addition, the old information board was replaced by new, more detailed boards and a camp tour was set up with the help of an audio guide.\n\n\n=== Friends of the site ===\nIn 2014 the \"

Engagements took place across vast areas of Anhui, Henan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Hubei provinces over a period of four and a half months. It was the longest, the largest, and arguably the most significant battle in the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War. More than one million National Revolutionary Army troops from the Fifth and Ninth War Zone were put under the direct command of Chiang Kai-shek, defending Wuhan from the Central China Area Army of the Imperial Japanese Army led by Shunroku Hata. Chinese forces were also supported by the Soviet Volunteer Group, a group of volunteer pilots from Soviet Air Forces.Although the battle ended with the eventual capture of Wuhan by the Japanese forces, it resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, as high as 1.2 million combined by some estimates. With the Japanese suffering their heaviest losses of the war, they decided to divert their attention to the north, which prolonged the war until the attack on Pearl Harbor. The end of the battle signaled the beginning of a strategic stalemate in the war, shifting from large pitched battles to localised struggles.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 7 July 1937, the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) launched a full-scale invasion of China after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. Both Beijing and Tianjin had fallen to the Japanese by 30 July, which exposed the rest of the North China Plain. To disrupt the Japanese invasion plans, the Chinese Nationalists decided to engage the Japanese in Shanghai, which opened a second front. The fighting lasted from 13 August to 12 November, with the Chinese suffering major casualties including \"

"Chandravakyas| Hindu astronomy| Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics| Indian astronomy texts| ","Chandrav\u0101kyas (IAST: Candrav\u0101kyas) are a collection of numbers, arranged in the form of a list,  related to the motion of the Moon in its orbit around the Earth. These numbers are couched in the katapayadi system of representation of numbers and so apparently appear like a list of  words, or phrases or short sentences written in Sanskrit and hence the terminology Chandrav\u0101kyas. In Sanskrit, Chandra is the Moon and  v\u0101kya means a sentence. The term Chandrav\u0101kyas  could thus be translated as  Moon-sentences.Vararuchi (c. 4th century CE), a legendary figure in the astronomical traditions of Kerala, is credited with  the authorship of the collection of Chandrav\u0101kyas. These were routinely made use of  for computations of native almanacs and for predicting the position of the Moon. The work ascribed to Vararuchi is also known as Chandrav\u0101ky\u0101ni, or Vararuciv\u0101ky\u0101ni, or Pa\u00f1c\u0101\u1e45gav\u0101ky\u0101ni.Madhava of Sangamagrama (c. 1350 \u2013 c. 1425), the founder of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics, had set forth a revised set of  Chandrav\u0101ky\u0101s, together with a method for computing them, in his work titled Venvaroha.Chandrav\u0101kyas were also popular in Tamil Nadu region of South India. There, the astrologers and astronomers used these v\u0101ky\u0101s to construct almanacs. These almanacs were popularly referred to as the V\u0101kya-pa\u00f1c\u0101\u1e45gas. This is used in contrast to the modern mode computation of almanacs based on parameters derived from astronomical observations that are known as D\u1e5bk Pa\u00f1c\u0101\u1e45gas ( or Thirukanitha Pa\u00f1c\u0101\u1e45gas).\n\n\n== V\u0101kya tradition ==\nThe Parahita system of astronomical computations introduced by Haridatta (ca. 683 CE), though simplified the computational processes, required  long tables  of numbers for its effective implementation. For timely use of these numbers they had to be memorised in toto and probably the system of constructing astronomical V\u0101kyas arose as an answer to this problem. The katapayadi system provided the most convenient medium for constructing easily memorable   \nmnemonics for the numbers in these tables. Chandrav\u0101ky\u0101s ascribed to Vararuci are the earliest example of such a set of mnemonics. The period of Vararuci of Kerala tradition has been determined as around fourth century CE and the year of the promulgation of the Parahita system is known to be 683 CE, Vararuci's Chandrav\u0101ky\u0101s should have been around at the time of the institution of the Parahita system.\nBesides Vararuci's V\u0101kyas, several other sets of V\u0101kyas had been composed by astronomers and mathematicians of the Kerala school. While Vararuci's V\u0101kyas contain a list of 248 numbers, another set of V\u0101kyas relating to Moon's motion contains 3031 numbers. There is a set of 2075 V\u0101kyas called Samudra-v\u0101kyas or Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala-v\u0101kyas or Kuj\u0101di-pa\u00f1cagraha-mah\u0101v\u0101kyas relating to the motion of the five planets Kuja (Mars), Budha (Mercury), Guru (Jupiter), Bhrigu (Venus) and Sani (Saturn). There are also lists of V\u0101kyas encoding other mathematical tables like Madhava's sine table.\n\n\n== V\u0101kya-pa\u00f1c\u0101\u1e45ga ==\nThe first known text to use these Chandrav\u0101kyass is Haridatta's manual on his Parahita system, known as Graha-c\u0101ra-nibandhana. The next major work that makes use of the mnemonic system of the V\u0101kyas  which has down to us is V\u0101kya-kara\u1e47a (kara\u1e47a, or computations, utilising V\u0101kyas). The authorship of this work is uncertain, but, is apocryphally assigned to Vararuci. The work is known to have been composed around 1300 CE. It has been extensively commented upon by Sundararaja (c.1500 CE) of Trichinopopy of Tamil Nadu. The almanac makers of Tamil Nadu fully make use of this V\u0101kya-kara\u1e47a for computing the almanacs. These almanacs are known as V\u0101kya-pa\u00f1c\u0101\u1e45gas.\n\n\n== Numbers encoded in Chandrav\u0101ky\u0101s ==\nThe Moon's orbit approximates an ellipse rather than a circle. The orientation and the shape of this orbit is not fixed. In particular, the positions of the extreme points,\nthe point of closest approach (perigee) and the point of farthest excursion (apogee), make a full circle in about nine years. It takes the Moon longer to return to the same position, perigee or apogee, because it moved ahead during one revolution. This longer period is called the anomalistic month, and has an average length of 27.554551 days (27 d 13 h 18 min 33.2 s). The apparent diameter of the Moon varies with this period. 9 anomalistic months constitute a period of approximately 248 days. The differences in the longitudes of the Moon on the successive days of a 248-day cycle constitute the Chandrav\u0101kyas. Each set of Chandrav\u0101kyas contains a list of 248 V\u0101ky\u0101s or sentences.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIndian astronomy\nIndian mathematics\nVararuchi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nFor details on Madhava's method of computation of Chandravakyas see : K.

It was the fourth budget after the 1988 Canadian federal election. It is the first budget presented by Don Mazankowski.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe budget is presented amid poor economic conditions and soaring federal deficit.\n\n\n== Taxes ==\nThe 1992 budget introduced significant changes to both personal and corporate income tax systems.\n\n\n=== Personal income taxes ===\nReduction in the personal surtax rate: the general personal surtax rate is lowered by 1 percentage point (to 4%) on 1 July 1992 and another (to 3%) on 1 January 1993.\nIntroduction of the Home buyers' plan (HBP): the budget created the HBP to allow individuals to withdraw up to $20,000 from their RRSPs to finance the purchase of a principal residence, repayable over 15 years.\nCreation of the Child Tax Benefit (CTB): starting January 1993 the CTB replaced family allowances, the child credit and the refundable child credit. The initial CTB amount is set at $1,020 with a Working Income Supplement of up to $500 for low-income working families.\n Increase of the child care expense deduction: the maximum deduction is increased by $1,000 ;\nThe increase in the RRSP and RPP limits is delayed by a year.\n\n\n=== Corporate income taxes ===\nThe budget reduces taxes imposed on corporations by $2 billions over the 1992-93 to 1996-97 period. The budget specifically provides relief to the manufacturing and processing industries that have been seriously affected by the recession.\nReduction in the manufacturing and processing tax rate: phased-in two steps, 22% on 1 January 1993 (down from 23%) and 21% on 1 January 1994 ;\nFaster depreciation for selected equipment: the CCA deduction rate for eligible manufacturing and processing machinery and equipment is increased from 25 to 30%.\n\n\n=== Other taxes ===\nThe withholding tax on direct dividends is reduced to 5% from 25%.\n\n\n== Expenditures ==\n\n\n=== Expenditure Control Plan ===\nThe Expenditure Control Plan announced in the 1990 budget and extended in 1991 is continued and broadened in the 1992 budget.\n\n\n==== Cuts ====\nThe Prime Minister and all cabinet ministers took a 5% pay cut on 1 April 1992 ;\nDepartments' budget were further cut by 3% between 1992-93 and 1996-97 and spending reductions of $170 millions in 1992-93 alone were imposed ;\nFederal departments' communication budgets were cut by $75 millions ;\nDefence spending was cut by $2.2 billions over the 1992-93 to 1996-97 years ;\n24 federal agencies are abolished or merged ;\n13 ministerial advising bodies are abolished or merged.\n\n\n==== Spending limitations ====\nNew travel guidelines were introduced to reduce costs ;\nGrowth in spending on social housing by the CMHC was capped at 3% yearly until 1996-97.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nThe budget garnered mixed reaction from columnist Jean-Paul Gagn\u00e9 from Les Affaires who pointed out that the budget was unextraordinary but contained some interesting measures (reduction in the income surtax, no increase in the GST rate, Home Buyers' Plan).\n\n\n=== Opposition ===\nThe Liberal leader of the Official Opposition in Ottawa Jean Chr\u00e9tien, and the NDP leader Audrey McLaughlin, criticized the budget for its lack of measures to fight unemployment. The Bloc qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Lucien Bouchard pointed out the budget was a proof that the federal government was at the end of its rope.\n\n\n=== Business community and labour unions ===\nThe budget was well received by the business community and especially real-estate and construction actors. The value of the Canadian dollar increased by 0.39 cents with respect to the United States dollar in the foreign exchange market the day after the budget speech. The TSX 300 index gained 35.52 points while the Montreal Stock Exchange index gained 19.39 points.Quebec's labour unions (CSN, CEQ and FTQ) were disappointed by the budget pointing out the lack of measures to fight unemployment and poverty and the lack of new infrastructure projects. The unions also criticized the abolition of the Economic Council of Canada.\n\n\n=== Provinces ===\nQuebec's finance minister, G\u00e9rard D. Levesque, received the budget favourably talking about a step in the right direction in that it did not reduce transfers to provinces.The PQ, the Official Opposition in Quebec, on the other hand decried the budget as cosmetic and not going far enough to fight unemployment although some tax relief measures (and especially the reduction in the personal surtax) were applauded.Ontario's NDP Finance minister Floyd Laughren also criticized the lack of measures to fight unemployment.\n\n\n== Legislative history ==\nSome minor changes announced in the budget (notably amendments to the Canada Student Loans Act and pay cuts for the Prime Minister and federal ministers) were included in the Budget Implementation (fiscal measures) Act, 1992 which received royal assent more than a year after the budget speech, on 2 April 1993.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Official documents ===\nBudget Papers 1992 (PDF).

It is dedicated to Saint Charalambos.\nAccording to a legend, repeated by Mihail Sadoveanu in Hanu Ancu\u021bei, there were two brothers from Epirus, Gheorghe and Haralambie Leondarie, who served as head messengers (ceau\u0219i) for Prince Constantine Ypsilantis at the end of the 18th century. After Haralambie became a hajduk, Ypsilantis ordered Gheorghe to capture the outlaw dead or alive, on pain of execution. The latter went on pursuit with fifty troops. While attempting to capture his brother near V\u0103ratec Monastery, Gheorghe accidentally killed him. He gave Haralambie's head to the prince, quit the service and, in order to obtain forgiveness, built the church on a plot of land granted by Ypsilantis. Begun in 1799, it was consecrated in 1804. The structure had three spires; the interior painting was done around 1900. The bell tower preserves one bell donated by the ktitor in 1804 and others from the parishioners. In the early 19th century, the church belonged to the guild of mercenaries in the prince's guard and to firearms makers. For a time, the church served Old Believers driven out of Russia.There was a graveyard outside the church; part of the remains were disinterred after Eternitatea cemetery was established in 1871, an exception being Gheorghe Leondari, who was buried there after his death in 1835. A hundred years later, his remains were placed in the church, on the right side of the nave. Also in 1935, the church was blessed a second time by Metropolitan Nicodim Munteanu. An athenaeum associated with the church was built in the yard in 1934. This hosted cultural figures, among the most popular speakers being philosopher Ion Petrovici. It was destroyed during World War II. After the 1977 Vrancea earthquake, the damaged spires were rebuilt in 1997-1998 and the interior repainted in 1987-1989. During the same period, the Micl\u0103u\u0219eni Monastery donated part of Saint Charalambos' relics to the parish. Following the Romanian Revolution, a bakery and food pantry were established at the church.The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes =="

The British Indian press was legally protected by the set of laws such as Vernacular Press Act, Censorship of Press Act, 1799, Metcalfe Act and Indian Press Act, 1910, while the media outlets were regulated by the Licensing Regulations, 1823, Licensing Act, 1857 and Registration Act, 1867. The British administrators in the India subcontinent (in modern-day Republic of India, Islamic Republic of Pakistan and People's Republic of Bangladesh) brought a set of rules and regulations into effect designed to prevent circulating claimed inaccurate, media bias and disinformation across the subcontinent.\nIn pre-independence, the government formulated several legal actions, including Gagging Act, comprised a set of rules for publishing, distributing and circulating news stories and operating media organizations working independently or running in the subcontinent.

It has been the de jure ruling party of Yemen since 1993, three years after unification. The party is dominated by a nationalist line, and its official ideology is Arab nationalism, seeking Arab unity. In the course of the Yemeni Civil War, the party's founder and leader Ali Abdullah Saleh was killed, while the GPC fractured into three factions backing different sides in the conflict.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe party was established on 24 August 1982 in Sana'a, North Yemen, by President Ali Abdullah Saleh, becoming an umbrella organisation that sought to represent all political interests. Following Yemeni unification in 1990, and with Saleh continuing as president of the united country, it emerged as the largest party in the 1993 parliamentary elections, winning 123 of the 301 seats. It went on to win a majority (187) of seats in the 1997 elections amidst a boycott by the Yemeni Socialist Party.\nSaleh was re-elected as President in the first direct presidential elections in 1999, and the party won a landslide victory in the 2003 parliamentary elections, winning 226 of the 301 seats. Following the elections, several independent MPs also joined the party. Saleh was re-elected again in 2006. After he was forced to stand down as a result of the Yemeni Revolution, the party's Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi was elected as his successor. Saleh attempted to regain power over the country and the GPC in the following civil war. Rallying a large part of the GPC in 2015, he sided with the Houthis and effectively split the party into a pro-Hadi and Saleh faction.The two factions were at war with each other until Saleh attempted to overthrow the Houthis. This power grab failed, however, and the former president as well as party secretary general Aref al-Zouka were killed in the Battle of Sana'a of late 2017. Following Ali Abdullah Saleh's death, the GPC fractured further, with a large part of the former Saleh followers pledging allegiance to the Houthis. This pro-Houthi part of the GPC continued to support the rebel government in Sana'a, and elected Sadeq Ameen Abu Rass as the new GPC chairman. One member of the pro-Houthi faction explained that \"

She was the author of the memoir Deceived with Kindness (1984), an account of her experience growing up at the heart of the Bloomsbury Group.\n\n\n== Family background ==\nAngelica Garnett was born at Charleston Farmhouse in East Sussex on Christmas Day 1918. She was the biological daughter of the painter Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell; her aunt was Virginia Woolf.\nUntil the summer of 1937, when Garnett was 18, she believed her biological father was Clive Bell, Vanessa's husband, rather than the mostly homosexual Grant, although the reality was an open secret within their immediate Bloomsbury circle. In fact, although there was no formal separation or divorce, the Bells' marriage had come to an end in 1916. In that year, Vanessa rented Charleston Farmhouse from the Gage estate, so that Duncan Grant, with whom she had fallen in love, and his lover, David Garnett, could work there as farm labourers; both were conscientious objectors. Grant and Vanessa Bell continued to live together after the presumed end of their sexual relationship. Clive Bell would visit at weekends.When Vanessa Bell informed her daughter of her true parentage she advised her not to talk about it. The deception avoided servant gossip and preserved the possibility of a legacy from Clive Bell's father who had settled allowances on his grandchildren. Angelica grew up believing that two of those grandchildren, Vanessa and Clive's sons, Julian Bell, who was killed in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War, and the art historian Quentin Bell, were her biological brothers, rather than her biological half-brothers. Vanessa comforted herself with the idea that her daughter had two fathers; \"

She currently plays second on Team Silvana Tirinzoni.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2006, Neuenschwander qualified for her first World Women's Curling Championship playing lead for Silvana Tirinzoni. The Swiss team struggled, finishing in tenth place with a 3\u20138 record. The following year, she returned to the Worlds at the 2007 Championship, this time playing third for Tirinzoni. The Swiss team lost their first three games but then turned things around and they nearly came back to qualify for the playoff round. Switzerland fell just short, finishing fifth with a 6\u20135 record.\nIn 2011, Neuenschwander won her first World Curling Tour event, the Red Deer Curling Classic. She would not play in an international championship until 2013, when she played second for Switzerland at the 2013 World Women's Curling Championship. After finishing the round robin with a 6\u20135 record, she found herself in a three-way tie for fourth. After beating Russia's Anna Sidorova in the first tie breaker, she lost to the United States' Erika Brown in the second, settling for fifth place. Team Tirinzoni has won several World Curling Tour since then, including the 2013 International Bernese Ladies Cup, the 2013 Stockholm Ladies Cup, the 2013 Women's Masters Basel and the 2014 Pomeroy Inn & Suites Prairie Showdown.\nNeuenschwander and her rink began the 2014\u201315 season by winning their first event, the 2014 Stu Sells Oakville Tankard. They also qualified for the playoffs at several other events and finished second at the Swiss nationals.\nWhile Neuenschwander did not return to an international competition for a while (due to strong competition in her home country from teams like Alina P\u00e4tz and Binia Feltscher), she and her rink have been strong on the World Curling Tour since then. The 2015\u201316 season included three tournament wins, including the first slam of the year, the 2015 GSOC Tour Challenge, where they beat the World #1 Rachel Homan rink in the final. The team would also win the International Bernese Ladies Cup and the Glynhill Ladies International later that year. They also made four other tournament finals.\nThe Tirinzoni rink continued their WCT success the following season, winning their first event, the 2016 Stu Sells Oakville Tankard, but did not win any further tournaments. They began the 2017\u201318 season by defending their Oakville Tankard title, which would be the third time she would win that tournament.\nIn one of the strongest countries, with three different World Champions including a two time World Champion and two time Olympic silver medalist, Team Tirinzoni won the right to be the Switzerland representative at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Her team finished undefeated throughout the 2017 Swiss Olympic Curling Trials. At the games, the team just missed out on a playoff spot, finishing with a 4\u20135 record.\nHeading into the 2018\u201319 curling season, Neuenschwander and Tirinzoni joined forces with Alina P\u00e4tz, who threw fourth rocks with Tirinzoni skipping at the third position. They brought on Melanie Barbezat to throw lead rocks. The team reached the final in the first Grand Slam of the season, the Elite 10. They represented Switzerland at the 2018 European Curling Championships claiming the silver medal, going on an unbeaten 9\u20130 run to finish top of the Round Robin, before defeating Germany 6\u20134 in the semi-final, and falling 5\u20134 to Sweden's Anna Hasselborg in the final. Having won the 2019 Swiss National Championships, the team represented Switzerland at the 2019 World Women's Curling Championship in Silkeborg, Denmark. The team got off to a shaky start posting a 2\u20133 record in their first five games before winning six in a row to secure their playoff spot, and, after a final round dead rubber loss, a round robin record of 8\u20134 and 4th place in the standings. Tight victories over China in the qualification game, and South Korea in the semifinal set up a repeat of the European Championship final against Hasselborg and Sweden. They were able to turn the tables on Sweden, with P\u00e4tz making a draw to the four-foot in the extra end for an 8\u20137 win which meant they were crowned the 2019 world champions. The team capped off their year with their first Grand Slam title together at the Champions Cup, and reaching the final of the inaugural Curling World Cup.\nAt the start of the 2019\u201320 season, Team Tirinzoni were runners-up at the 2019 Cameron's Brewing Oakville Fall Classic. They also qualified for the playoffs at their next three events, the 2019 Stu Sells Oakville Tankard, the 2019 AMJ Campbell Shorty Jenkins Classic and the 2019 WCT Uiseong International Curling Cup. The next week, they won the Women's Masters Basel. They represented Switzerland at the 2019 European Curling Championships where they finished the round robin in first place with an 8\u20131 record. However, they would not make the final, as they lost to Scotland's Eve Muirhead in the semifinal. They rebounded in the bronze medal game, defeating Alina Kovaleva of Russia. The team would not get to defend their title as world champions, losing the final of the 2020 Swiss Women's Curling Championship to the young Elena Stern rink. The Swiss championship would be the team's last event of the season, as both the Players' Championship and the Champions Cup Grand Slam events were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Team Tirinzoni began the 2020\u201321 season by making the final of the 2020 Schweizer Cup where they once again lost to the Stern rink. Three weeks later, the team was invited to play in the Adelboden International men's World Curling Tour event, as a last minute addition. After dropping their first game to Yannick Schwaller, they went on a four-game winning streak against the men's field before losing to Olympic bronze medallist Peter de Cruz in the semifinal. In January 2021, Neuenschwander compted at the 2021 Swiss Mixed Doubles Curling Championship with partner Michael Brunner. The pair finished the round robin with a 4\u20133 record, just missing the playoffs. Two weeks later, Team Tirinzoni won the 2021 Swiss Women's Curling Championship. This put them in a playoff against 2020 Champions Team Stern for the right to represent Switzerland at the 2021 World Women's Curling Championship, as the 2020 Worlds were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Team Tirinzoni beat Stern in the playoff, and represented Switzerland at the World Championship, which was played in a bio-secure bubble in Calgary, Canada due to the pandemic. There, they finished with a 12\u20131 round robin record, including scoring a rare eight-ender against Denmark, the first time an eight-ender has ever been scored at a World Championship. In the playoffs, the team defeated the United States in the semifinal, and then Alina Kovaleva representing RCF (Russia) in the final to win the gold medal, successfully defending their 2019 championship. While also in the Calgary bubble, Team Tirinzoni played in two Grand Slam events, making the final at the 2021 Champions Cup and the semifinals at the 2021 Players' Championship.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nNeuenschwander employed as an accountant.\n\n\n== Teams ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEsther Neuenschwander at World Curling Federation\nEsther Neuenschwander at Olympics.com\nEsther Neuenschwander at Olympedia\nTeam Tirinzoni's Home Page"

The town has a permanent population of 10. William Creek is in the federal Division of Grey and the state electorate of Stuart. It is outside of council areas, and administered by the Outback Communities Authority.\n\n\n== Location ==\nWilliam Creek is the entry point from Coober Pedy to Lake Eyre in the Tirari Desert. William Creek offers the only petrol station between Marree, Coober Pedy and Oodnadatta on the Oodnadatta Track and has a campground, two motels and one of the world's most remote pubs. The world's largest cattle station is located in nearby Anna Creek Station and the Woomera Prohibited Area, is also nearby.\nWilliam Creek is a good halfway stop along the track, with accommodation and meals at the Hotel as well as a well-maintained, if somewhat dusty campground. In the Memorial Park it is possible to see many diverse items although more sobering is the commemorative inscription to a young Austrian woman, who lost her life in 1998 trying to walk back to William Creek from a 4WD vehicle bogged in the sand beside Lake Eyre. The first stage of the Black Arrow Rocket, Britain's only successful independent space launch was recovered from the surrounding Anna Creek Station and located in the memorial park for nearly 50 years but has been recently brought back to the UK by technology firm Skyrora.William Creek is serviced twice weekly by the Coober Pedy Oodnadatta One Day Mail Run. The 4WD mail truck also carries some general freight and passengers.\n\n\n== History ==\nWilliam Creek was named in November 1859 by explorer John McDouall Stuart during his expeditions in the area. William was the second son of John Chambers, a pioneer pastoralist of South Australia and a strong ally of Stuart.The town was once on The Ghan railway line.The town has always been small: never larger than a few cottages, a small school and a Hotel-store.The historic William Creek Hotel is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.\n\n\n== Near William Creek ==\nLake Eyre can be seen from several vantage points along the Oodnadatta Track and appears as a large, rather featureless, white saltpan.

It had a narrower chancel, also with a raised central roof, and a semicircular apse. It was surrounded by a gallery loosely connected to the plank walls.In 1735, the chancel and apse, as well as the east wall of the nave, were removed. The nave was extended eastwards and two transepts were added, making a cruciform plan. The additions were built in horizontal log construction with notched corners.  Portal planks are decorated with carved vines and animal ornamentation. Since few parts of the stave church are preserved, there are only scant remnants of its original decor. Of the original stave church, only three outer walls survived, as the internal posts and the raised roof were eliminated.The churchyard is fenced with slate brought from Haukeli farm on the west bank of the L\u00e5gen River.  Some slates have iron rings affixed; these rings were used to tether horses during service. Each farmer had a designated ring for his horse (the oldest dated ring from 1661). The idiosyncratic stone fence is shown on a 1701 painting (the oldest existing painting of a stave church).\nThe interior of the church is characterized by the reconstruction of 1735. There are a few remains of medieval furnishings. There is a decorated lion and a lionhead that also originates in the Middle Ages.

"International_Society_of_Arachnology| Arachnological societies| ","The International Society of Arachnology (ISA) promotes the study of arachnids and the exchange of information among researchers in this field. It acts as an umbrella organisation for regional societies and individuals interested in spiders, and related animals, and organises an International Congress every three years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Conception ===\nThe idea of arachnologists coming together for scientific meetings stems from the German zoologist Hermann Wiehle in 1959. He encouraged Wolfgang Crome (Berlin) and Ernst Kullmann (Bonn) in this matter and a subsequent meeting of the German Zoological Society in Bonn in 1960 was used as a platform for the first arachnological meeting; with about 20 (mostly German) scientists in attendance. A second meeting, again associated with the German Zoological Society, followed in Saarbr\u00fccken in 1961 organised by Otto Kraus, and attracted additional international participation. The third meeting, again organised by Otto Kraus, was held in Frankfurt am Main in 1965 under the title III. Kongre\u00df europ\u00e4ischer Arachnologen.\n\n\n=== C.I.D.A. ===\nDuring preparations for the Frankfurt meeting Otto Kraus and the French zoologist Max Vachon discussed the establishment of a formal organisation to improve international cooperation among arachnologists. In 1963 of the Centre International de Documentation Arachnologique (C.I.D.A.) based at the Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle in Paris was formed. Max Vachon was the first Pr\u00e9sident and Otto Kraus the Pr\u00e9sident-adjoint; with Kraus becoming Pr\u00e9sident in 1965 and Vachon Secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. A series of national correspondents were also appointed as local representatives of the emerging society.\nFrom 1963, C.I.D.A. began to produce, every three years, an Annuaire des Arachnologistes Mondiaux \u2013 a list of active workers in the field of arachnology, cross-referenced by country and research interests \u2013 and a Liste des Travaux Arachnologiques \u2013 an annual list of recent scientific publications in this field. Following Frankfurt, further international meetings were held on a regular three year cycle beginning with the IV\u00e8me Congr\u00e8s International d\u2019Arachnologie in 1968 in Paris, and thereafter known as the International Congress of Arachnology.\n\n\n=== ISA ===\nAdministration of C.I.D.A. remained for many years in Paris, largely under Jacqueline Heurtault who was elected Secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral adjoint in 1968 and Secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral in 1983. Following her retirement from the post in 1998, administration of the society moved to Washington, D.C. with Jonathan Coddington at the United States National Museum taking over as Secretary. At the same time a proposal was made at the 1999 Chicago meeting to change the name to International Society of Arachnology (ISA).\nThis phase also saw the start of a homepage and subsequently an electronic mailing list, which gradually came to replace the older printed documentation such as the Liste and the Annuaire. Earlier international congress proceedings were produced either in special congress volumes or local journals, but since 1999 the proceedings have been published in a dedicated issue of the Journal of Arachnology produced by the American Arachnological Society. Since 2002 administration of the society moved to Berlin and Jason Dunlop at the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde. From 2007 the society has begun to make a series of awards during its international meetings to honour senior colleagues in the field.\n\n\n== The society ==\nThe society is headed by an executive committee which includes a President, Vice-President, Past-President, Treasurer, Secretary and Webmaster; plus a number of ordinary council members. In addition to this, there are regional correspondents. Ideally one is appointed for each country, and they act as local representatives and contact points for questions relating to spiders and other arachnids. A general assembly of the society is held every three years during the international congress. As of 2015, ISA has about 560 members world-wide encompassing most of the world's professional and semi-professional arachnologists.\n\n\n== Past and current presidents ==\n2019\u20132022: Wayne Maddison, Canada\n2016\u20132019: Paula Cushing, US\n2013\u20132016: Yael Lubin, Israel\n2010\u20132013: Charles Griswold, US\n2007\u20132010: Nikolaj Scharff, Denmark\n2004\u20132007: Ansie Dippenaar-Schoeman, South Africa\n2001\u20132004: Paul Selden, United Kingdom\n1998\u20132001: Robert Raven, Australia\n1995\u20131998: Norman Platnick, US\n1992\u20131995: Rudy Jocqu\u00e9, Belgium\n1989\u20131992: Volker Mahnert, Switzerland\n1986\u20131989: Konrad Thaler, Austria\n1983\u20131986: Peter Van Helsdingen, Netherlands\n1980\u20131983: Herbert Walter Levi, US\n1977\u20131980: Paolo Tongiorgi, Italy\n1974\u20131977: Lambertus Vlijm, Netherlands\n1971\u20131974: Eric Duffey, United Kingdom\n1968\u20131971: Roland Legendre, France\n1965\u20131968: Otto Kraus, Germany\n1963\u20131965: Max Vachon, France\n\n\n== Society awards ==\n\n\n=== Simon award ===\nNamed after Eug\u00e8ne Simon, this award is given for lifetime achievement.

"Richard_Stewart_Dobbs| 1808 births| 1888 deaths| ","Major General Richard Stewart Dobbs (10 May 1808 \u2013 26 September 1888), son of Rev. Richard Stewart Dobbs and Harriet Macauley, was a British civil servant. He served as the first Superintendent of Chittledroog (Chitradurga) Division, in the princely state of Mysuru (Mysore), British India, from 1834 to 1861. Tumakuru was the then headquarters of this division. He subsequently rose to the rank of Major-General in the 9th Regiment of the Madras Native Infantry\n A small town, Dobbspet, located in the Nelamangala taluk of Bengaluru district, is named after him.\nOne of the major successes during his administration, as he has recorded in his reminiscences, was that he was completely successful in nabbing most of the professional robbers (Lambanis, Koramas and Korachas) in the Chitradurga - Tumakuru region, and ridding this province of this social menace. \nHe was a shikari and would hunt in and around Devarayanadurga hill and forests. He wrote of the presence of sambur (which the British of that time referred to as elk) near the Devarayanadurga hill top, apart from tigers in the forests around the hill. According to Dobbs, an entire dead blackbuck would be available at the Tumakuru market for four annas (approximately 25 paise or 1/4 of an Indian Rupee). This common antelope was so abundant in the areas surrounding Devarayanadurga, that one British officer shot 200 of these magnificent creatures within a few days.He devised a new method of trapping tigers of which there plenty in the region those days. British officers also indulged in \u2018pig-sticking\u2019 or spear hunting of wild boar as well as shooting sloth bears in the division. He narrates that the reduction of tigers and leopards in the division due to hunting led to an increase in wild boar which damaged sugarcane plantations. A tiger that was killed about four miles from Tumakuru city was skinned and the skin was gifted to a family friend in Scotland.He was a devout Christian who supported missionary activity and was equally enchanted by the wildlife and serenity atop Devarayanadurga hill. Though he himself did not have the gift of song, he always enjoyed the singing of hymns by his guests when sitting with them atop the hill while watching the beautiful sunsets. The bungalow he built atop the hill is now being used as a police wireless communication centre. \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe was married to Jane Margaret Cathcart (15 April 1811 \u2013 24 January 1892), daughter of Robert Cathcart on 18 April 1834. The couple had eleven children: eight sons, Richard Stewart Dobbs (d. 1908), Robert Cathcart Dobbs (1835 \u2013 1914), Francis Hugh Dobbs (1838 \u2013 1857), Alexander Fairlie Dobbs (1839 \u2013 1912), Col.

Two years later, in 1995, he successfully ran for provincial councillor and, after the election, was appointed provincial minister of Agriculture.In the 1998 provincial election, Zaia was elected President of the Province of Treviso with 60.0% of the vote in the second round, after arriving ahead in the first round with 41.4% and refusing to accept the support of any other party other than his own. At the time, he was the youngest provincial president of Italy. In 2002 he was re-elected with a landslide 68.9% of the vote in the second round and continued to govern the province with the sole support of his party.In May 2005, Zaia was appointed Vice President of Veneto and regional minister of Agriculture and Tourism in Galan III Government, but left in May 2008 in order to take office as federal Minister of Agriculture in Berlusconi IV Cabinet.In December 2009, The People of Freedom (PdL) determined that the coalition candidate in the 2010 regional election would be a member of Lega Nord.

It opened in 1858 and it is one of the oldest railways in Germany.\nThe route is an important part of the long-distance connection between the industrial district of west Saxony and western Germany (the Mid-Germany Connection). It runs from a branch on the Dresden\u2013Werdau in Glauchau-Sch\u00f6nb\u00f6rnchen via Meerane to a branch on the Leipzig\u2013Hof line near G\u00f6\u00dfnitz.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the planning of a westerly extension of the Riesa\u2013Chemnitz line, several routes were investigated for a connection to the Saxon-Bavarian Railway. Connections towards Zwickau, Crimmitschau and G\u00f6\u00dfnitz were discussed. A connection to G\u00f6\u00dfnitz or Crimmitschau would shorten the line from Chemnitz to Leipzig, while a line to Zwickau offered major advantages for coal transport.

"Calydiscoides| Monopisthocotylea| Monogenea genera| Diplectanidae| ","Calydiscoides is a genus of monopisthocotylean monogeneans, included in the family Diplectanidae.The genus currently includes 16 species, which are all parasitic on the gills of marine fish of the family Lethrinidae and Nemipteridae. All species are from the Indo-Pacific Ocean.\nThe type-species of the genus is Calydiscoides australis Young, 1969.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\n\nAll species of Calydiscoides are small animals, ranging 0.5\u20131 mm in length.\nAs with most monogeneans, they are flat, with an anterior head bearing four oculi and head glands, a main elongate body and a posterior haptor. The digestive system includes an anterior muscular pharynx, and two lateral intestinal branches (or caeca); as in all Platyhelminthes, there is no anus. The haptor, in the posterior part of the body, is a specialized organ used to attach to the host. The haptor includes sclerotized elements, namely a ventral bar, two lateral (dorsal) bars, two ventral hooks, and two dorsal hooks, and fourteen hooklets. As in most diplectanids, the haptor bears characteristic, structures called squamodiscs (one ventral and one dorsal).\nThe squamodiscs of species of Calydiscoides are special: they are lamellodiscs, which are made up of concentric lamellae, not separate rodlets as in regular squamodiscs. The diameter of the lamellodiscs range 25\u201360 \u00b5m. When observed from its concentric axis (ventral or dorsal observation of the specimen, \u2018polar\u2019 view of the lamellodisc), the lamellodisc appears as concentric circles. Generally, central lamellae are circles, but peripheral lamellae may be circles or semicircles.\nAdults are hermaphroditic. The reproductive organ include a single ovary and a single testis. As in all diplectanids, the ovary (or germarium) is anterior to the testis and loops around the right intestinal caecum.\nSpecies of Calydiscoides are characterized by a sclerotized male copulatory organ, which is used in systematics to differentiate species.\n\n\n== Systematics ==\nThe characteristics of the lamellodisc, without paired elements, is the main character which differentiate Calydiscoides from other genera of the family Diplectanidae. Relationships of Calydiscoides Young, 1969 with Protolamellodiscus Oliver, 1969 are not clear; the two genera were described almost simultaneously, and it might be that they are synonym.\n\n\n== Hosts ==\n\nHosts of species of Calydiscoides are only members of the families Nemipteridae (Threadfin breams) and Lethrinidae (Emperors). These families are restricted to the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Lethrinids known to harbour Calydiscoides species include Lethrinus miniatus, Lethrinus nebulosus and Lethrinus atkinsoni; nemipterids include Nemipterus japonicus, Scolopsis temporalis, Scolopsis monogramma, Scolopsis margaritifera and Pentapodus aureofasciatus.

The range was named on 12 June 1861 by explorer Francis Thomas Gregory after Edward Hamersley, a prominent promoter of his exploration expedition to the northwest. Juukan Gorge lies within the ranges, as does Karijini National Park (formerly known as Hamersley Range National Park).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe traditional Aboriginal owners of the area that the range runs through are the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples.In 1999 a small range within the Hamersley was named the Hancock Range after the Hancock family, who were pioneers in the area. The Hancock range is east of Karijini National Park in a region of broad valleys and peaks that rise to almost 1,200 metres (3,937 ft). The Hancock Range is close to Mulga Downs Station, a property owned by the Hancock family and where Lang Hancock is buried.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe range runs from the Fortescue River in the northeast, 460 kilometres (290 mi) to the south. The range contains Western Australia's highest point, Mount Meharry, which reaches approximately 1,249 metres (4,098 ft) AHD. There are many extensively eroded gorges, such as Wittenoom Gorge. The twenty highest peaks in Western Australia are in the Hamersley Range. Peaks in the range include Mount Bruce (1,234 metres (4,049 ft)), Mount Nameless/Jarndunmunha (1,115 metres (3,658 ft)), Mount Reeder Nichols (1,109 metres (3,638 ft)), Mount Samson (1,107 metres (3,632 ft)), Mount Truchanas (1,148 metres (3,766 ft)) and Mount Tom Price (775 metres (2,543 ft)).Karijini National Park (formerly Hamersley National Park), one of Australia's largest national parks, is centred in the range.\n\n\n== Juukan Gorge ==\n\nA cave in Juukan Gorge, about 60 kilometres (37 mi) from Mt Tom Price, was one of the oldest in the western Pilbara region, and the only inland site in Australia to show signs of continuous human occupation through the Ice Age.Mining company Rio Tinto received ministerial consent to damage the site in 2013 in the pursuit of expanding their iron ore mining operations, but a year later, an archaeological dig discovered the site was more than twice as old as previously thought and rich in cultural artefacts, including sacred objects. One particularly significant finding was a length of plaited human hair, woven together from strands from the heads of several different people, about 4,000 years old. DNA testing revealed that the hair had belonged to the direct ancestors of Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people alive today.

His natural position is right-back but he can also play at left-back, centre-back, and in midfield.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Portsmouth ===\n\nWard started his footballing career with local youth team East Lodge and signed a professional contract with Portsmouth in July 2008 after spending two years in the Academy and Reserves.\n\n\n==== AFC Bournemouth (loan) ====\nThe following month, he signed a one-year loan deal with AFC Bournemouth to gain first team experience. Ward soon made his debut in a League Cup match against Cardiff City on 12 August, playing the full 90 minutes as Cardiff ran out 2\u20131 winners. His League Two debut came later that week on 16 August 2008 in an away draw with Aldershot Town. As the season progressed, Ward continued to appear in defence for the Cherries and he gained the first yellow and red cards of his career on 18 October in a 4\u20131 away defeat to Shrewsbury Town, eventually being sent off for two bookable offences. However, his form meant that he returned to the side soon afterwards, making his Football League Trophy and FA Cup debuts: a home defeat by Colchester United and a home win against Bristol Rovers on 4 and 8 November respectively. He scored his first and only Bournemouth goal in a 4\u20130 win over Morecambe on 2 May 2009.\n\n\n==== Return to Portsmouth ====\nOn 26 August 2009, Ward made his Portsmouth debut as a centre-back against Hereford United in the League Cup, before making his Premier League debut on 14 April 2010 against Wigan Athletic, playing from start to finish at left-back as the game finished goalless. Ward played in most of Pompey's remaining league matches that season and remained at Fratton Park in the summer even after they were relegated to the Championship. He began the new season as first-choice right-back, but later lost his starting berth to Wolverhampton Wanderers loanee Greg Halford. Ward scored his first Portsmouth goal in a 3\u20132 defeat to Doncaster Rovers on 13 November 2010.Starting with their 2\u20130 away victory over Doncaster Rovers on 12 February 2011, a game in which he scored, Ward played as an attacking midfielder in Portsmouth's new 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation and earned praise from manager Steve Cotterill who was quoted as saying: \"

In its more trafficked southern end it is known as North Cherry Street and outside Hammond, North Cherry Street Extension. LA 1065 is a two-lane highway for the entirety of its 11.1-mile-length (17.9 km).\n\n\n== Route description ==\nFrom the south, LA 1065 begins at US 190 in Hammond's Historic District.  Proceeding due north, it bridges Ponchatoula Creek and forms a T-intersection with LA 3234 (University Avenue) on the west.  It leaves Hammond and enters Tickfaw, crossing crosses LA 1064 (Natalbany Road) and LA 442.  North of LA 442, LA 1065 enters Independence and has six sharp turns, the last cosigning it with Cypress Street near central Independence. At the intersection of Cypress Street and Tiger Avenue (so named because the tiger is the mascot of adjacent Independence High School), LA 1065 turns west to follow Tiger Avenue in crossing the Canadian National Railway and immediately to end at the perpendicular US 51 (West Railroad Avenue); directly across that intersection, LA 1063 (cosigned with Fifth Street) assumes the trajectory of LA 1065 and Tiger Avenue.  \n\nLA 1065 supports egress for Southeastern Louisiana University via LA 3234.

She coached the New Zealand national team to its first world title at the 1967 World Netball Championships. The Taini Jamison Trophy, contested between New Zealand and visiting international teams other than Australia, is named in her honour.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nJamison was born Taini Maremare Royal in Rotorua in 1928. Her father, Te Rangi\u0101taahua Kiniw\u0113 Royal, was of Ng\u0101ti Raukawa and Ng\u0101ti Tamater\u0101 descent, and her mother, Irihapeti Te Puhi-o-R\u0101kaiora Taiaroa, was from Ng\u0101i Tahu. Her father worked for the M\u0101ori Land Court and was often away from home carrying out surveys. The family briefly moved to Ruatoki in the eastern Bay of Plenty because of his job. He served with the M\u0101ori Battalion in World War II, was badly wounded and was awarded the Military Cross. Jamison studied at Rotorua High and Grammar School, but when her father was posted to Wellington after the war she moved to Wellington Girls' College, later studying at Wellington Teachers' Training College. In Wellington, she joined the Ng\u0101ti P\u014dneke Young M\u0101ori Club, which was much in demand to perform at government functions. She recalls performing for the famous British singer Gracie Fields, when Fields was touring the South Pacific in 1945.After qualifying as a teacher, she had several different postings. When based in Horohoro, near Rotorua, she met her husband, Tom Jamison, who was coaching the local basketball team. Three months after they married, he died after an accident on the basketball court. She was already pregnant and her son was named after her husband. She did not remarry. Jamison spent eight years teaching in Horohoro before moving to Malfroy Primary School in Rotorua, where she stayed until reaching retirement age.\n\n\n== Netball career ==\nJamison's interest in netball began at a young age. She progressed to being a member of the Rotorua representative team, which won the national championships, and she was selected for the North Island team on three occasions. She retired from competition in 1959, after which she spent a decade coaching the Rotorua team. She also competed in tennis tournaments.In 1967, Jamison coached the New Zealand netball team that won the World Netball Championships in Perth, Australia. Four years later, she coached the New Zealand team to the runners-up position in the 1971 World Netball Championships in Jamaica, when the team was away from home for almost four months. She was the first M\u0101ori coach of the New Zealand netball team, and is its most successful coach, having a percentage win rate of 90 per cent. Jamison has been involved for nearly all of her adult life with Netball Rotorua and was its president from 1981 to 2001.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nIn 1972, Jamison was awarded the Netball New Zealand Service Award. In the 1994 New Year Honours, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to netball. Jamison was inducted into the M\u0101ori Sports Hall of Fame in 2006, and in 2010, she was made a life member of Netball New Zealand.In 2008, the Taini Jamison Trophy was established. It is contested when any netballing nation or nations, other than Australia, play the Silver Ferns in New Zealand.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External link ==\nBrief video of Taini Jamison in 2020"
"Emotional_promiscuity| Emotions| Free love| Interpersonal relationships| ","Emotional promiscuity has been addressed in both the popular press as well as in scientific literature.\n\n\n== Popular Press ==\nIn the popular press, there was a book published in 2007 entitled, Avoid the Heartbreak of Emotional Promiscuity, written by Brienne Murk.  In her book, Murk argues that (a) guarding one's heart is required for staying pure, (b) emotions cannot be trusted, and (c) that young people must set physical and emotional boundaries.  Murk also attempts to discourage young people from having premarital sex and engaging in activities she deems impure. The book is written from a Christian perspective, and its assertions based on the author's religious interpretations.\n\n\n== Scientific Literature ==\nIn scientific literature, Jones (2011) examined the concept of Emotional Promiscuity as a personality/individual difference construct  Jones defines emotional promiscuity as the predisposition to fall in love easily, fast, and often.  Such individuals tend to love the feeling of falling in love, and want to be with many romantic partners.\nEmotional promiscuity can be assessed through self-report using the Emotional Promiscuity Scale (or EP Scale; and is distinct from both sexual promiscuity and anxious attachmentIn addition, emotional promiscuity poses a health risk when combined with sexual promiscuity.In particular individuals who fall in love frequently and easily, and who are also comfortable with casual sex, have many unprotected sexual partners. The authors argue this finding results from premature trust which eventuates into the faulty perception that protection is unnecessary.\n\n\n== References =="

At the invitation of some rebels, he conquered the Kingdom of Sicily and became King of Sicily in 1282, pressing the claim of his wife, Constance II of Sicily, uniting the kingdom to the crown.\n\n\n== Youth and succession ==\nPeter was the eldest son of James I of Aragon and his second wife Violant of Hungary. Among opportunistic betrothals of his youth, he was betrothed to Eudoxia Laskarina, the youngest daughter of Theodoros II Laskaris, in or before 1260 (claim not substantiated). This contract was dissolved, however, after Eudoxia's brother lost the imperial throne in 1261, and Eudoxia was instead married to the Count of Tenda. On 13 June 1262, Peter married Constance II of Sicily, daughter and heiress of Manfred of Sicily. During his youth and early adulthood, Peter gained a great deal of military experience in his father's wars of the Reconquista against the Moors.On his father's death in 1276, the lands of the Crown of Aragon were divided amongst his two sons. The Kingdom of Aragon, the Kingdom of Valencia and the Catalan counties went to Peter III as being the eldest son; while the Kingdom of Majorca and the Catalan counties beyond the Pyrenees went to the second son, who became James II of Majorca.\nPeter and Constance were crowned in Zaragoza in November 1276 by the archbishop of Tarragona.\n\n\n== Early rebellions ==\n\nPeter's first act as king was to complete the pacification of his Valencian territory, an action which had been underway before his father's death.\nHowever, a revolt soon broke out in Catalonia, led by the viscount of Cardona and abetted by Roger-Bernard III of Foix, Arnold Roger I of Pallars Sobir\u00e0, and Ermengol X of Urgell. The rebels had developed a hatred for Peter as a result of the severity of his dealings with them during the reign of his father. Now they opposed him for not summoning the Catalan Courts, and confirming its privileges after his ascension to the throne.\nAt the same time, a succession crisis continued in the County of Urgell. When \u00c0lvar of Urgell died in 1268, the families of his two wives, Constance, a daughter of Pere de Montcada of Bearn, and Cecilia, a daughter of Roger-Bernard II of Foix, began a long fight over the inheritance of his county. Meanwhile, a good portion of the county had been repossessed by Peter's father, James I, and was thus inherited by Peter in 1276. In 1278, Ermengol X, \u00c0lvar's eldest son, succeeded in recovering most of his lost patrimony and came to an agreement with Peter whereby he recognised the latter as his suzerain.In 1280, Peter defeated the stewing rebellion led by Roger-Bernard III after besieging the rebels in Balaguer for a month. Most of the rebel leaders were imprisoned in Lleida until 1281, while Roger-Bernard was imprisoned until 1284.\n\n\n== Wars abroad ==\n\n\n=== Tunisia ===\nWhen Muhammad I al-Mustansir, the Hafsid Emir of Tunisia who had put himself under James I of Aragon, died in 1277, Tunisia threw off the yoke of Aragonese suzerainty. Peter first sent an expedition to Tunis in 1280 under Conrad de Llansa designed to re-establish his suzerainty. In 1281, he himself prepared to lead a fleet of 140 ships with 15,000 men to invade Tunisia on behalf of the governor of Constantine. The fleet landed at Alcoyll in 1282. It was these Aragonese troops that received a Sicilian embassy after the Vespers of 30 March asking Peter to take their throne from Charles I of Anjou.\n\n\n=== War of the Sicilian Vespers ===\n\nIn 1266, Charles I of Naples, with the approval of Pope Clement IV, invaded the Kingdom of Sicily, governed by the house of Hohenstaufen, which was the house of Peter's wife, Constance II of Sicily, daughter of Manfred of Sicily and rightful heir to the throne of Sicily after the deaths of her father and cousin Conradin fighting against Charles's invading forces. This made Peter the heir of Manfred of Sicily in right of his wife.\nThe Italian physician John of Procida acted on behalf of Peter in Sicily. John had fled to Aragon after Charles' success at the Battle of Tagliacozzo. John travelled to Sicily to stir up the discontents in favour of Peter and thence to Constantinople to procure the support of Michael VIII Palaiologos. Michael refused to aid the Aragonese king without papal approval, and so John voyaged to Rome and there gained the consent of Pope Nicholas III, who feared the ascent of Charles in the Mezzogiorno. John then returned to Barcelona but the Pope died, to be replaced by Pope Martin IV, a Frenchman and a staunch ally of Charles and the Anjou dynasty. This set the stage for the upcoming conflict.\nConstance thus claimed to her father's throne, supported by her husband, but the claim was fruitless, as Charles was supported by the Papacy and his power remained stronger. The election of a new Pope Nicholas III in 1277 gave the King of Aragon a glimpse of hope, but Nicholas somehow died in 1280 and a pro-French Pope Martin IV dissipated hopes.\nPeter nevertheless had begun making strategic alliances with his neighbouring monarchs. Peter made his brother James II of Majorca sign the treaty of Perpignan in 1279, in which he recognized the Kingdom of Majorca as a feudal kingdom of Peter III (making the Crown of Aragon an indissoluble unity). Peter  pressed his advantage and by February 1283 had taken most of the Calabrian coastline. Charles, perhaps feeling desperate, sent letters to Peter demanding they resolve the conflict by personal combat. Peter accepted and Charles returned to France to arrange the duel. Both kings chose six knights to settle on places and dates, and a duel was scheduled for 1 June at Bordeaux. A hundred knights would accompany each side and Edward I of England would adjudge the contest; the English king, heeding the pope, however, refused to take part. Peter left John of Procida in charge of Sicily and returned via his own kingdom to Bordeaux, which he entered in disguise to evade a suspected French ambush. Needless to say, no combat ever took place and Peter returned to find a very turbulent Aragon.He also had a long-lasting friendly relationship with the Kingdom of Castile, establishing a strong alliance between realms by signing the treaties of Campillo and \u00c1greda in 1281 with Alfonso X of Castile and infant Sancho.\nWith the Kingdom of Portugal, Peter established a marital alliance by which his eldest daughter Elizabeth of Aragon married Denis I of Portugal.\nPeter also made alliance with England, engaging his heir Alfonso III with Eleanor of England, daughter of Edward I of England. Despite all these alliances, Peter kept his bad relationship with the Kingdom of France.\nOn 30 March 1282 there was a popular uprising in the Kingdom of Sicily called the Sicilian Vespers, against the government of Charles I of Anjou. The noble sicilian rebels asked for Peter for help and offered him the crown as they considered his wife Constance their rightful Queen, and after receiving an embassy from the people of Palermo at Alcoy, Peter landed at Trapani on 30 August 1282. He was proclaimed King in Palermo on 4 September. Charles was forced to flee across the Straits of Messina and be content with his Kingdom of Naples. Pope Martin IV excommunicated both Peter and Michael VIII Palaiologos for providing Peter with 60,000 gold pieces to invade Sicily.Catalan ground troops were commanded by Guillem Galceran de Cartell\u00e0, and were formed by the famous and feared almogavars, crossbowmen and lancers. Peter's powerful fleet was commanded by Roger of Lauria, and constantly repelled Angevin attacks to the island. Roger de Lauria defeated the French forces at the Battle of Malta, and at the Bay of Naples in 1284, where Charles was made prisoner.\nThe conquest of Sicily was financed by Jewish contributions and taxes charged to the aljamas. The infant Alfonso demanded them an allowance of 200,000 sous in 1282. The aljamas from the Kingdom of Valencia gave 25,000 sous, the Aragonese 75,000 and 100,000 were charged to the Catalan aljamas. The Kingdom of Sicily was to be a tenaciously-pursued inheritance for the Aragonese royal house and its heirs for the next five centuries.\n\n\n== Later domestic unrest ==\nPeter was dealing with domestic unrest at the time when the French were preparing an invasion of Aragon. He took Albarrac\u00edn from the rebellious noble Juan N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Lara, he renewed the alliance with Sancho IV of Castile, and he attacked Tudela in an attempt to prevent Philip I of Navarre from invading on that front. Peter held meetings of the cortes at Tarragona and Zaragoza in 1283. He was forced to grant the Privilegio General to the newly formed Union of Aragon.Also in 1283, Peter's brother James II of Majorca joined the French and recognised their suzerainty over Montpellier. This gave the French free passage into Catalonia through Roussillon as well as access to the Balearic Islands. In October, Peter began preparing the defences of Catalonia. In 1284, Pope Martin IV granted the Kingdom of Aragon to Charles, Count of Valois, another son of the French king and great-nephew of Charles I of Anjou. Papal sanction was given to a war to conquer Aragon on behalf of Charles of Valois.\n\n\n== Aragonese Crusade ==\n\nIn 1284, the first French armies under Philip and Charles entered Roussillon. They included 16,000 cavalry, 17,000 crossbowmen, and 100,000 infantry, along with 100 ships in south French ports. Though the French had James's support, the local populace rose against them. The city of Elne was valiantly defended by the so-called \"

They are located in Wuze Town, an indoor area of the park.\nThe rides consist of two similar tracks which mirror each other at first but also feature some unique sections. The cars seat four people, two facing backwards, and freely spin after the first drop. In theory, this would mean every single ride would spin in a unique pattern. However, several sections of track are designed to make optimal use of the car's momentum, forcing the car to move in certain ways.\nThe two roller coasters are raised via a vertical lift instead of the traditional lifthill. The Winjas feature a unique hinged section of track about halfway through, with Fear collapsing forward and Force banking sideways in order to continue. The two coasters travel on separate tracks and are intertwined in the main hall of Wuze Town. At the very end of the ride, a little surprise element is built in, which shortly drops a section of track a few feet and raises it again.\nThe ride is themed to fit the Wuze Town environment, a fictional town of myths and fantasy. The character Winja after whom the rides are named, is the main character of the area. A soundtrack specially written for the Winja's can be heard in the queuing area. Two samples of the soundtrack for the 2000 Disney film Dinosaur are also used during the ride, respectively the lift and hinged sections."

"Pyromorphite| Lead minerals| Phosphate minerals| Halide minerals| Hexagonal minerals| Minerals in space group 176| Luminescent minerals| ","Pyromorphite is a mineral species composed of lead chlorophosphate: Pb5(PO4)3Cl, sometimes occurring in sufficient abundance to be mined as an ore of lead. Crystals are common, and have the form of a hexagonal prism terminated by the basal planes, sometimes combined with narrow faces of a hexagonal pyramid. Crystals with a barrel-like curvature are not uncommon. Globular and reniform masses are also found. It is part of a series with two other minerals: mimetite (Pb5(AsO4)3Cl) and vanadinite (Pb5(VO4)3Cl), the resemblance in external characters is so close that, as a rule, it is only possible to distinguish between them by chemical tests. They were formerly confused under the names green lead ore and brown lead ore (German: Gr\u00fcnbleierz and Braunbleierz). \nThe phosphate was first distinguished chemically by M. H. Klaproth in 1784, and it was named pyromorphite by J. F. L. Hausmann in 1813. The name is derived from the Greek for pyr (fire) and morfe (form) due to its crystallization behavior after being melted.Paecilomyces javanicus is a mold collected from a lead-polluted soil that is able to form biominerals of pyromorphite.\n\n\n== Properties and isomorphism ==\nThe color of the mineral is usually some bright shade of green, yellow or brown, and the luster is resinous. The hardness is 3.5 to 4, and the specific gravity 6.5 - 7.1. Owing to isomorphous replacement of the phosphorus by arsenic there may be a gradual passage from pyromorphite to mimetite. Varieties containing calcium isomorphously replacing lead are lower in density (specific gravity 5.9 - 6.5) and usually lighter in color; they bear the names polysphaerite (because of the globular form), miesite from Mies in Bohemia, nussierite from Nuizi\u00e8re, Ch\u00e9nelette, near Beaujeu, Rh\u00f4ne, France, and cherokine from Cherokee County in Georgia.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of minerals\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

The county is named for Cobb.\n\n\n=== Early settlers ===\nHomes were built by early settlers near the Cherokee town of Big Shanty (now Kennesaw) before 1824. The first plot was laid out in 1833. Like most towns, Marietta had a square (Marietta Square) in the center with a courthouse. The Georgia General Assembly legally recognized the community on December 19, 1834.Built in 1838, Oakton House is the oldest continuously occupied residence in Marietta. The original barn, milk house, smokehouse and well house remain on the property. The gardens contain the boxwood parterre from the 1870s. Oakton was Major General Loring's headquarters during the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain in 1864.Marietta was initially selected as the hub for the new Western and Atlantic Railroad and business boomed. By 1838, roadbed and trestles had been built north of the city. In 1840, political wrangling stopped construction for a time and, in 1842, the railroad's new management moved the hub from Marietta to an area that became Atlanta. In 1850, when the railroad began operation, Marietta shared in the resulting prosperity.The businessman and politician John Glover arrived in 1848. A popular figure, Glover was elected mayor when the city incorporated in 1852. Another early resident was Carey Cox, a physician, who promoted a \"

It was soon succeeded by the P-120 Malakhit (SS-N-9 'Siren').\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe P-5 Pyatyorka (SS-N-3 Shaddock) missile required the Project 659 submarines carrying them to spend 30 minutes or more on the surface when firing. This made submarines very vulnerable to enemy attack, so in the 1960s the Soviets started work on a new missile that could be fired whilst submerged, and a submarine to carry it. These became the P-120 Malakhit and Project 670 submarine.\nHowever, problems with the engines of the P-120 Malakhit forced the Soviets to design a sub-launched missile based on the P-15M Termit (SS-N-2C 'Styx') as a stopgap measure for the first batch of Charlie submarines.  This became the P-20L, later renamed the P-70 Ametist.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe P-15M was fitted with an L band active radar homing sensor and a new radar altimeter both developed for the P-120, but there was no room for a datalink in the smaller P-15M. Folding wings were added to reduce the size of the missile, and the missile can be launched at a maximum depth of 30 m (98 ft).\nThe short range of the P-70 meant it did not need mid-course updates from a radar on the submarine, so it could be fired submerged. This more than made up for its lack of range compared to the P-5.\n\n\n== Operational history ==\nThe P-70 went into service with the Soviet Navy on the first Project 670, on June 3, 1968. About 200 were produced.\nIndia leased the Chakra, a Soviet Project 670 submarine from January 1988 to 1992, to gain experience of operating a nuclear submarine.\n\n\n== Operators ==\n Soviet Union\n Russia\n India\n North Korea\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMARITIME STRIKE The Soviet Perspective\nwww.dtig.org Russian/Sovjet Sea-based Anti-Ship Missiles (pdf)"

"Excellence_theory| Public relations| ","The Excellence theory is a general theory of public relations that \u201cspecifies how public relations makes organizations more effective, how it is organized and managed when it contributes most to organizational effectiveness, the conditions in organizations and their environments that make organizations more effective, and how the monetary value of public relations can be determined\u201d. The excellence theory resulted from a study about the best practice in public relations, which was headed by James E. Grunig and funded by the Foundation of the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC) in 1985. Constructed upon a number of middle-range theories, and tested with surveys and interviews of professionals and CEOs in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and South Korea, the Excellence theory provides a \u201ctheoretical and empirical benchmark\u201d for public relations units.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Excellence Theory explained that the value of public relations lies in organization-public relations. Good relationship with its strategic publics is helpful for an organization to develop and achieve goals desired by both the organization and its publics, reduce costs of negative publicity, and increase revenue by providing products and services needed by stakeholders. To maximize value of public relations, public relations must identify strategic publics and build long-term relationships with them through symmetrical communication programs. The excellence theory also shows that an organization's reputation is largely a byproduct of these organizational behaviors and organization-public relationships, reemphasizing the important strategic role that public relations has in organizational governance.The Excellence study identified characteristics of effective public relations in four major categories: \n\nEmpowerment of public relations function: effective organization must empower public relations as a critical management function\nCommunicator roles: let public relations executives play managerial role as well as administrative role\nOrganization of communication function: public relations should be an integrated communication function and separate from instead of being sublimated to marketing or other management functions\nPublic relations models: effect organization should base its internal and external communication and relationship building on two-way symmetrical model.\n\n\n== Historical Development ==\nThe excellence theory evolved from four approaches: goal attainment, systems, strategic constituencies, and competing values, with the competing values approach bridging the gap between strategic constituencies and organization's goals by stating that an organization must integrate strategic constituencies\u2019 values with its goals so that the organization attains the goals of most value to its strategic constituencies.\n\n\n=== Goal Attainment ===\nThe goal-attainment approach states that organizations are effective when they meet their goals. In 1952, Cutlip and Center first described the concept of public relations management. In 1954, Drucker proposed management by objectives approach, which warned that managers might get involved in day-to-day activities and forget their main objectives, and suggested that everybody within an organization should have a clear understanding of the organization's aims, and awareness of their own roles and responsibilities in achieving those aims.\n\n\n=== Systems ===\nThe systems approach here recognizes the importance of environment for an organization to be effective by indicating mutual need between an organization and its environment. According to the open system theory proposed by von Bertalanffy, a system is a complex of interacting elements, and \u201ca system is ...open if there is import and export, and therefore, change of the components\u201d (p. 23). Similarly, organizations are linked with resources in their external environment, and in the meantime, external environment needs products and services from the organizations.\n\n\n=== Strategic Constituencies ===\nThe strategic constituencies approach identifies the elements of the environment whose opposition or support can threaten the organization's goals or help to attain them. It based on Grunig's situational theory of publics and multi-systems theory of organizational communication. The situational theory postulates that people can be identified and classified according to their problem awareness and information seeking behavior in problems solution process. The situational theory provided a means to segment stakeholders as nonpublic, latent public, aware public, and active public according to their relationship and response to a problem. The multi-systems theory of organization communication explains that it is important for organizations to deal with communication at various system levels, including employee subsystems, consumer system, intersystem relations between employees and a clientele, public relations communications of the total organization, and inter-organizational communication.\n\n\n=== Competing Values ===\nOrganizational literature shows that organizational effectiveness can be sorted according to criteria of competing values model:\n\nStability vs. Flexibility: represents debating viewpoints in order, control, authority, versus diversity, individual initiative, and organizational adaptability.\nInternal vs. External: refers to conflict between emphasis on well-being of people in an organization and emphasis on development of the organization itself.\nMeans vs. Ends: emphasis on process like planning and goal setting.\n\n\n== Extension ==\n\n\n=== Global Theory of Public Relations ===\nDuring the last decade, scholars have replicated the excellence study around the world. Results from these studies extended the Excellence theory into a global public relations theory, which provides generic principles that are understood in the same way around the world and can be operated effectively in most nations. The global public relations theory also suggests that practice in different countries should be different based on culture, the political or economic system, media system, level of economic development, and extent and nature of activism in a certain country.For example, Rhee (2002) conducted a cross-cultural study of the excellence theory in South Korea, finding that the theory could be used to explain South Korean public relations practice. Rhee's study surveyed public relations practitioners in three types of organizations located in Seoul, the capital of South Korea, using subsets of the original excellence questionnaire and questions to measure the dimensions of culture. All principles examined in Rhee's study\u2014dimensions of communication, knowledge potential for public relations, participant in strategic management, support for public relations, and value of public relations\u2014were consistent with the excellence theory and also showed the validity of the theory as it relates to the cultural context of Korea. However, Rhee noted in the study that cross-cultural replication of this study is necessary to explore and further develop a global public relations theory.  \n\n\n=== Personal Influence Model ===\nThe Personal influence model is developed by Sriramesh, which described practitioners building personal influence with key individuals like government regulators, media, and tax officials by doing favor for them so that they could solicit favors in return when the organizations need help. Sriramesh  noted that this model plays a dominant role in many developing countries. Therefore, this model is known as the non-Western model.\n\n\n=== Public Relations Scales ===\nAfter reviewing the development and criticisms of the excellence theory, Laskin (2012) proposed ways to modify the public relations models proposed in the excellence theory and translate them into new and improved dimensions of five continuous and measurable scales. Laskin's study proposes the construction of these five scales\u2014the direction of communication scale, intended beneficiary scale, strategic nature scale, role scale, and timeframe scale\u2014that would be able to measure concepts of communication and balance of intended effects. However, Laskin says this instrument does not have to be limited to just these five scales and that one should be able to add or drop scales to better capture the peculiarities of a specific campaign, organization, or industry. \n\n\n== Criticism ==\nMany scholars have questioned the possibility of the two-way symmetrical model in real-life context. Van der Meiden  observed that the two-way symmetrical model is unrealistic since it suggests that organizations should value the interests of their publics more than those of the organization. Murphy  proposed that the concept of symmetrical communication works along a continuum from pure conflict to pure cooperation, which is based on mixed motives. Leichty  argued that completely collaborative public relations is not feasible in some situations, and pointed out that public relations practitioners\u2019 lack of power within an organization further increases the limitation of collaboration. Cameron and his colleagues developed the contingency theory of accommodation, which represent the stance movement of an organization toward a given public at a given time and in a given situation  and suggests that the true excellence in public relations may result from picking the appropriate point along the continuum that best fits the current need of the organization and its publics. Researchers have also found that excellence theory may underpin and perpetuate inequalities of power by imposing a monocultural and normative management model, which can devalue national traditions, minorities and cultural differences, and subject the wellbeing of society to corporate profitability.\n\n\n== References =="

The story by Annie Nocenti follows Chase Revere, manager of the local history museum, who discovers that an Indian casino is about to be built over the town's Revolutionary War battlefield. He joins forces with the sexy town siren, Lucy Shanks, to launch an all-out offensive against the project. They encounter fierce opposition from the corrupt mayor, the town council and local citizens, who believe that the casino will cure the bankrupt town's financial woes.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nChase Revere manages Patriotville's history museum, the run-down town's sole tourist attraction. Having inherited a love of history from his late mother, Chase happily devotes most of his free time to maintaining the museum's exhibits, directing reenactments on the site of a Revolutionary War battle, and preparing a proposal to expand the museum. His friend Digs, who has devoted himself to having sex with as many high school girls as possible, is disgusted at this and wants Chase to join him on the dating scene.\nA group of Native Americans arrive in town, taking up temporary residence in the hotel run by Chase's father, to consider setting up a casino in Patriotville. They negotiate with the town government for a bribe by threatening to have the casino built in Sulfur Falls instead. Feeling the town needs the casino to keep from going bankrupt, the mayor resorts to taking $1,000,000 out of various town projects to fund the bribe.\nChase spots a girl, Lucy, trying to get into her father's car. She sets the interior on fire and convinces Chase to give her a ride away from the scene before he realizes what's happening. Lucy comes from Sulfur Falls and tracked her father to Patriotville after he abandoned Lucy and her mother for another woman. Though she claims to be after a family heirloom that her father took, Chase intuits that Lucy is obsessed with her father. Intrigued, he asks for her phone number.\nDigs, whose father is on the town council, tells Chase about the casino deal. Chase is incensed even before learning that the proposed building site is the historical battlefield, believing that the casino will desecrate the town's culture. Digs also advises against dating Lucy, since his cousin dated her and says she is resolutely chaste. Chase and Lucy's first date seems to go well, but she firmly refuses his request for a kiss.\nChase and Lucy start a petition to put the casino issue to a vote. They meet opposition from both the government and the general citizenry, who seem convinced that the casino's financial benefits outweigh the battlefield's historical value. They tear up their fliers, call upon legal technicalities to shut down their protests, make threatening phone calls, vandalize their houses, print news articles describing them as communists, and fire Chase from the museum. Chase's father is unsupportive, and seemingly pays no attention to anything Chase says. Chase and the Native Americans maintain their budding friendship, expressing mutual respect even in their disagreement.\nThe mayor's wife confronts Chase and Lucy with a selfie of Lucy and the mayor having sex.

As a student, he trained in history, political science, economics, and art at the universities of G\u00f6ttingen, Leipzig, and Munich. Lamprecht taught at the university in Marburg and later at Leipzig, where he founded the Institut f\u00fcr Kultur und Universalgeschicht center dedicated to comparative world and cultural history.\nLamprecht was employee at the successful edition project \u201cThe Chronicles of the German Cities\u201d under the leadership of the well-known and highly reputated German historian Karl von Hegel.Lamprecht studied German and European social and economic history, particularly of the Middle Ages. He aroused considerable controversy with his loose interdisciplinary methods and focus on broad social, environmental, and even psychological, questions in history. To him, history meant as much the revelation of sociology as of political events.\nLamprecht's ambitious Deutsche Geschichte (13 vols., 1891-1908) on the whole trajectory of German history sparked a famous Methodenstreit (methodological dispute) within Germany's academic history establishment, especially Max Weber, who habitually referred to Lamprecht as a mere dilettante. Lamprecht came under criticism from scholars of legal and constitutional history like Friedrich Meinecke and Georg von Below for his lack of methodological rigor and inattention to important political trends and ideologies. As a result, Lamprecht and his students were marginalized by German academia, and interdisciplinary social history remained something of a taboo among German historians for much of the twentieth century. However, during the years of the series' publication, his work enjoyed a wide readership among the nonacademic German community.\nHe was the chief exponent of the Kulturgeschichte (\u201cHistory of Culture\u201d), and believed intensely in the superiority of German culture. Shortly before his death he repudiated, with some indignation, the conception of Germany's part in World War I as having been dictated by \u201cwar lords,\u201d and avowed that in regard to it that Germany was united.\nLamprecht died in Leipzig on 10 May 1915 from what appears to have been the result of internal bleeding brought on by a perforated ulcer.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nAccording to Ernst Breisach,\n\nLamprecht himself stipulated psychological forces as the basic forces in all of history. But they derived from the collective psyche of every nation and not from the idiosyncratic forces of individual psyches. Historiography p. 279Lamprecht found a much more positive reception for his ideas and methods in France and the United States. In 1904, he was invited to give a series of lectures at Columbia University, which were translated and published in 1905 as What is History?\n\nLamprecht failed to convince other historians, but a mutant of the idea of a Volksseele intruded into French historiography as the concept of a period's mentality, especially as mentalit\u00e9 or sensibilit\u00e9 in Febvre's work. Breisach p.342-3Lamprecht's work was a formative influence in the thinking of the French social historian Marc Bloch as well the Annales School. One of his students was Cai Yuanpei, who later served as the chancellor of Beijing University and had an enormous influence on modern Chinese thought.\n\n\n== Select works by Karl Lamprecht ==\nDeutsches Wirtschaftsleben im Mittelalter, 3 vols., Leipzig 1885-1886 (Aalen 1969)\nDeutsche Geschichte, 12 vols. + 2 incomplete vols., Berlin  1891-1909\nDie kulturhistorische Methode, Berlin 1900\nLamprecht, Karl (1905).

"Guerino_Vanoli_Basket| 1999 establishments in Italy| Basketball teams established in 1999| Basketball teams in Lombardy| ","Guerino Vanoli Basket, also known as Vanoli Cremona, is a professional basketball team of the city of Cremona. The team played in the LBA, the top Italian basketball league, for 12 years until 2021. \nFrom 1999 to 2011 the society had the name of Gruppo Triboldi Basket. For past club sponsorship names, see the list below.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The beginnings and the promotion to Serie A ===\nThe U.S. Gruppo Triboldi Basket was founded in 1999 in Soresina by Secondo Triboldi. The team, with Simone Lottici as coach, soon reached the Serie B d\u2019Eccellenza, the third Italian league. Not having a suitable arena for this league, the club moved to the nearby indoor stadium in Cremona C\u00e0 de Somenzi, keeping the seat in Soresina. After five seasons in the third Italian league, in the 2005-06 season arrived the promotion in Legadue with Andrea Trinchieri on the bench, finishing first in the group A, and after winning the play-offs by beating in order Cento, Forl\u00ec and Osimo.\nThe first year in Legadue, Gruppo Triboldi finished the regular season in fourth place, being eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Pavia. At the end of the season Trinchieri left the role of head coach and moved to Caserta, being replaced by Stefano Cioppi. After a fifth place in the following season and elimination in playoffs semifinals by Caserta, the club achieved the promotion to Serie A after finishing the 2008-2009 season in third place and winning the play-offs beating in order Pavia, Casale Monferrato and Sassari.\n\n\n=== The Serie A debut ===\nAfter the promotion to Serie A, some managers of Juvi Cremona (which gives the Serie A Dilettanti\u2019s title to Leonessa Brescia) entered in the company. Moreover, the company's registered office was transferred from Soresina to Cremona.\nAt the end of the first season in Serie A, ended with the 13th place in the standings, the General Manager Ario Costa and Vice President Matteo Bonetti left the team to join Leonessa Brescia in Serie A Dilettanti, the third Italian league, so the owner Secondo Triboldi decided to appoint as General Manager Flavio Portaluppi, who had played in the team just two seasons before, after a year spent at Olimpia Milano. The coach for the 2010-11 season is Slovenian Tomo Mahori\u010d.\n\n\n=== The change of ownership and the following seasons in Serie A ===\n\n\n==== The 2011-2012 season ====\nAt the end of the 2010-11 season, after the club achieved the 12th place, the President Secondo Triboldi resigned from his office and gave his titles away for free. In September, 2011 Aldo Vanoli became President of the team and called it  Guerino Vanoli Basket, in honor of his father.\nFor the 2011-12 season most of the previous year team is confirmed, included the coach Tomo Mahori\u010d. In Cremona arrived among the others Jonathan Tabu, replacing E. J. Rowland, passed meanwhile to Unicaja Malaga and especially Von Wafer, who had previously played in the NBA.\nThe beginning of the season, however, is rather disappointing with four defeats and one victory, against the newly promoted Casale Monferrato in the first five matches. Because of these results, after only a month Tomo Mahori\u010d was fired and in its place arrived Attilio Caja, former coach of Cremona in the second half of the 2009-10 season. In the first days of December the team's top scorer, Von Wafer, returned in the NBA as a result of the end of the lockout. During the following months the team changed several players but the results, despite some good performances, remained erratic especially away and the team occupied the last positions of the standings. After the defeat against Casale Monferrato, which seemed to compromise the stay in Serie A, the trend of the season suddenly changes. Since the beginning of February the team, led by the newly arrived Jason Rich, won nine of the last thirteen league games, beating even teams ranked high such as Virtus Bologna and Olimpia Milano. Thanks to these results, the team managed to avoid relegation with a few match in advance and finished the season in 10th place, the best result in the history of the club.\n\n\n==== The 2012-2013 season ====\nAlthough the disappearance of the company due to lack of funds sounded almost certain, at the end of the season the club stayed alive thanks to new sponsors and regularly began the 2012-13 season. Coach Attilio Caja was confirmed, while the General Manager Portaluppi went back to Olimpia Milano. Due to the low budget, the club acquires player mostly from Legadue, the second Italian League. In September, the italian point guard Luca Vitali, a member of the Italian National Team, joined the team. The season started badly, with the team occupying the last positions in the standings. Caja was fired on November 21, 2012. Luigi Gresta, the assistant coach, took his place. Luca Vitali soon became the leader of the team and lead the team right up to the play-off zone, thanks to some victories against top teams, such as Sassari, Milano and the Italian champions in charge of Siena. Apart from Vitali, also other players such as Jarrius Jackson, Hrvoje Peri\u0107 and Andrija Stipanovi\u0107 had a very positive impact for the team. Cremona ended the season in 11th place.\n\n\n==== The 2013-2014 season ====\nIn the summer the club had to face an economic crisis which seemed to prevent the team to play in the top Italian League the following year. At the end, a group of local entrepreneurs entered in the society and helped economically the President Aldo Vanoli. For the fifth consecutive year the club joined Serie A. The coaching staff, led by Luigi Gresta, was confirmed but almost all the players of the past year went away. Particularly, the two top players, Vitali and Peric, joined the same team, the italian Reyer Venezia. The team acquired some prestigious players such as Jason Rich, the hero of the 2011-12 season and Ben Woodside, who had been the previous year the best assistman throughout Europe. Despite this signatures, the club get lower results than expected so, after two wins in nine games, coach Gresta was fired. The hiring of the experienced coach Cesare Pancotto changed the season. After four initial loss, the team won the following four matches and managed to get a quiet second half of the season. Cremona ended in the 14th place.\n\n\n==== The 2018-2019 season ====\nVanoli Cremona was qualified for the 2019 Italian Basketball Cup. Cremona defeated Varese 82-73 in the quarterfinals and then they topped Virtus Bologna 102-91. Cremona went to win its first Cup ever by beating New Basket Brindisi 83\u201374 in the Finals. Drew Crawford was named Panasonic MVP of the competition.On 12 July 2020, Vanoli Basket announced the club intended to leave the LBA after a period of 11 years due to a lack of economic support.

In so doing he became Kiwi number 181. He also represented the Lower Waikato, South Auckland (Waikato), and Auckland representative rugby league teams from 1919 to 1927.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nIvan Littlewood was born on 20 October 1902 in Taupiri, in the Waikato region of New Zealand. He was the son of Sarah Jane and Frederick Walker Littlewood. Ivan was the second youngest of twelve children with 8 older sisters; Mary Esther May, Ruby Ethel Wardlow, Laura Mabel Hamilton, Ivy Eleanor Muriel, Alice Eliza Pearl, Gladys Evelyn Elsie, Eileen Frances, and Bertha Margaret, a younger sister; Ada Dorothy Winifred, and two older brothers; Frederick Henry Carlton, and Albert. His father Frederick died on 26 May 1914 in Taupiri.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\n\n\n=== Waikato Beginnings ===\nIvan Littlewood began his playing career in the Waikato region. The first record of him playing was for the Lower Waikato representative side against the touring Australian team on 18 September 1919. He would have been a month short of his nineteenth birthday. Littlewood played in the three-quarters, setting up his sides only try in a 58\u20135 loss.In 1920 he again appeared for Lower Waikato and played in a match against King Country on 17 July.

"Hedruris_spinigera| Spirurida| Nematodes described in 1931| ","Hedruris spinigera is a parasite belong to phylum Nematoda, commonly found in the stomach of freshwater fish. The female Hedruris spinigera attaches itself onto the epithelium of the fishes' stomach using a hook at the curved tail. Meanwhile, the male swims freely until it finds a female that has already attached to a host, then the male curls around the body of that female so that sexual reproduction occurs within the host. Most fishes consume Paracorophium excavatum, the intermediate host for Hedruris spinigera; however, the prevalences of Hedruris spinigera are restricted to certain host range.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\nHedruris spinigera have four complex lips consisting of two lateral pseudolabia and two median lips. The oesophagus is not clearly divided into muscular and glandular portions. The body of Hedruris spinigera is covered by non-living cuticles. The female Hedruris spinigera has a prehensile hook at the posterior end. Immature adults within the intermediate host are similar to mature adults, except for the smaller size and absence of eggs.\n\n\n== Geographic distribution ==\nHedruris spinigera are widely distributed within New Zealand. scientists found that the distribution appears to be limited within the coastal area, especially in brackish waters. The prevalence of Hedruris spinigera depends on species of fishes. The prevalence in intermediate hosts was found infected with one worm, but sometimes two or three worms could also be found in intermediate hosts.\n\n\n== Life cycle ==\nThe intermediate host for Hedruris spinigera is the amphipod crustacean Paracorophium excavatum. Hedruris spinigera has limited host range because some fishes failed to establish Hedruris spinigera due to lack of the proper attachment site on epithelium of fish stomach. Although most fishes consume Paracorophium excavatum, Hedruris spinigera actually distribute in only a limited host range. Scientists have found that Aldrichetta forsteri and Retropinna retropinna fish species are the truly suitable hosts for Hedruris spinigera. The infection site in the adult worm occurs at the stomach where the female attaches to, but parasite could also be free-living as found in rectum and intestine of fishes. As for immature Hedruris spinigera, the site of infection occurs at hemocoelomic cavity, where the worms are coiled but not encysted.\n\n\n== References =="

"Thrinax_radiata| NatureServe apparently secure species| Thrinax| Flora of the Dominican Republic| ","Thrinax radiata, the Florida thatch palm, is a medium to slow growing palm in the family Arecaceae. It is native to many Caribbean islands, Central America, and far southern Florida. Its natural habitat is sandy, calcareous soil in coastal areas.\n\n\n== Description ==\nLike all palms, this species grows thick and low to the ground before sending its meristem vertical, gaining the form of a slender tree.\nThis species has no crownshaft and the canopy appears to emerge directly from the trunk. On average this species reaches a height of 20 feet. It has large compoundly segmented leaves which are 4 to 5 feet wide and 2.5 feet long. The leaves are palmate and divide into segments about halfway down their length with the leaf emerging from the petiole in what is described as a pointed hastula shape. The entire canopy consists of between 10 and 20 large leaves and on average gains only 6 inches of height per year. The shape of the canopy varies depending on its amount of insolation, with full sun specimens appearing more globular or compact, and shaded specimens having a longer, more spread-out canopy. This species can flower when the tree is only 6 feet tall. The inflorescences exceed 3 feet in length, arch downwards, and can extend below the frond. The flowers are white, bisexual, and occur year-round, with peak production in the spring. The resulting fruits, called drupes, are white and can also be seen year round.\nIt can be distinguished from the similar-looking genus Coccothrinax by its white drupes, whereas the drupes in Coccothrinax are black or yellow.  Another distinguishing characteristic of Thrinax are its split leaf bases, while the leaf bases of Coccothrinax are fused.\n\n\n== Common names ==\nFlorida thatch palm, Jamaican thatch, Chit, Silk-top thatch palm, Sea thatch palm, Caribbean thatch palm.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nThrinax radiata is found primarily in coastal scrub areas from the Caribbean to Mexico, and can even grow in exposed limestone. It is also occasionally found in pinelands in South Florida and semi-evergreen forests in the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula. Its seeds are eaten and presumably dispersed by many animals including bats, spider monkeys, toucans, armadillos, and deer. Young leaves are also eaten by spider monkeys, and mature ones serve as a refuge for several bat species In Florida (Elliott Key in particular), the invasive Mexican red-bellied squirrel (Sciurus aureogaster) has had an extremely negative impact on T. radiata populations. It uses palm fibers as nesting materials and consumes the palm itself, often killing the plant.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThrinax radiata belongs to the order Arecales, family Arecaceae, genus Thrinax, and the species T. radiata\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nIn the wild, this species almost always grows close to coastal areas where it is adapted to tolerating heavy winds, high concentrations of salt, and even drought.  It naturally grows in sandy and calcareous soils where it does best in high pH soil. This species is native to regions of the southern United States and the Florida Keys, western Cuba, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Hispaniola, the eastern coast of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of Mexico, Belize, Honduras, and Nicaragua.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThis species appears to be secure globally, however it is rare at the northern edge of its range in Florida. While it is commonly cultivated as a landscape plant in residential areas, its status is the wild in Florida is poor and it is only rarely encountered. There are currently no specific efforts being undertaken to reduce the severity of this status in the United States. There are, however, restrictions on harvesting in Mexico, where human use has had a greater impact on T. radiata populations.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nThis species is commonly used as a landscaping tree along roadways and in residential areas in South Florida (zone 10).  Today, it is being widely planted outside of its natural historic range in South Florida and the Caribbean because of its ability to grow under various conditions. It is used by gardeners and can be grown in containers or in arboretums, which showcase this species\u2019 prolific inflorescences and fruit. Its common name derives from the use of its fronds in thatched roofing. Its fronds are the most used part of the palm, being utilized in broom construction, handicrafts, and food wrapping. T. radiata's white fruit are edible its trunks have recently been used to construct lobster traps by fishermen in the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References =="

The modern village is built around the Roman ruins, which are some of the best-preserved in Europe. It remained prominent through the Roman era and Early Middle Ages as the site of a road crossing between several important civic centres. The community includes Llanvair Discoed.

"Pavlovsky_Posad| Cities and towns in Moscow Oblast| ","Pavlovsky Posad (Russian: \u041f\u0430\u0301\u0432\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0430\u0301\u0434) is a town and the administrative center of Pavlovo-Posadsky District in Moscow Oblast, Russia, located 68 kilometers (42 mi) from Moscow, at the confluence of the Klyazma and Vokhna Rivers. Population: 63,711\u2009(2010 Census); 61,982\u2009(2002 Census); 71,297\u2009(1989 Census).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe town of Pavlovsky Posad was founded in 1844 by merging several villages (Pavlovo, Dubrovo, Zakharovo, and Melenki). From its very foundation, the land on which the town stands belonged to the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius monastery of the Russian Orthodox Church. Later, from the mid-17th century, the land came into state ownership. Due to these peculiarities, Pavlovsky Posad never knew serfdom.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Pavlovsky Posad serves as the administrative center of Pavlovo-Posadsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Pavlovo-Posadsky District as the Town of Pavlovsky Posad. As a municipal division, the Town of Pavlovsky Posad is incorporated within Pavlovo-Posadsky Municipal District as Pavlovsky Posad Urban Settlement.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nFrom the very beginning Pavlovsky Posad has had the textile industry as its main business. This industry is still the most prominent in modern town. During the 1990s, most textile factories were transformed into public corporations and went through bankruptcy. The public float index for these factories is currently extremely low: about 90-95% of each factory's shares are owned by one person.\nThe town has also always been famous for its Pavlovo Posad shawl factories. One of these factories, Pavlovo-Posadkaya Manufaktura, is still producing traditional shawls and kerchiefs in the Russian style. Some other factories survived by concentrating on fire-equipment (such as fire hoses); whereas others yet are producing vestments for Orthodox priests.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nThe Moscow\u2013Vladimir railway goes through the town.\n\n\n== Religion ==\nPokrovsko-Vasilyevsky Monastery was established near the cemetery in the beginning of the 20th century. In the monastery there's a cathedral that actually incorporates two independent churches: the upper church of Pokrov and the lower of St. Basil the Confessor, who was Vasily Gryaznov's saint patron. For his missionary work among the old believers, Vasily Gryaznov was granted sainthood in 1999. A cathedral also has a belltower. Both the cathedral and the belltower are built in the so-called pseudo-Russian style. There's also a little church of St. Andrey Rublev at the monastery gates.\n\nThere are also three more Orthodox churches and one Old Believers' Orthodox church.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nLocal attractions include several 19th-century factory buildings, a local museum, a museum of Russian shawls and kerchiefs, and an exhibition center. Some old tombstones could be found on local Old Believer's cemeteries. There are also many old buildings in the streets of the town center.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nValery Bykovsky, cosmonaut\nOleg Chukhontsev, poet\nNatalya Petrusyova, speed skater\nVyacheslav Tikhonov, actor\nVasily of Pavlovsky Posad, Russian Orthodox saint\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\u0413\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116123-\u041f\u0413 \u043e\u0442 28 \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2010 \u0433. \u00ab\u041e\u0431 \u0443\u0447\u0451\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0438 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446 \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u00bb, \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u2116252-\u041f\u0413 \u043e\u0442 26 \u0438\u044e\u043d\u044f 2015 \u0433. \u00ab\u041e \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0443\u0447\u0451\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0438 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446 \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u00bb.  \u041e\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d: \"

Different techniques are used to automate patch clamp recordings from cells in cell culture and in vivo.  This work has been ongoing since the late 1990s by research labs and companies trying to reduce its complexity and cost of patch clamping manually.

The automation techniques try to reduce user error and variability in obtaining quality electrophysiology recordings from single cells.\n\n\n== Manual patch clamp ==\n\nThe traditional manual method to patch clamp using glass pipettes was developed by Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann and required a highly skilled technician.  The technician would position the glass pipette near a cell and apply the appropriate suction to create an electrical seal between the pipette and the cell membrane.  This seal ensures a quality recording by preventing any current from leaking out between the tip of the pipette and the cell membrane.  This seal is made when the membrane of the cell chemically binds with the tip of the pipette so that the inside of the pipette is only connected to the cytoplasm of the cell.

"Understanding_of_Self_and_Identity| Ego psychology| Identity (social science)| Psychology stubs| ","Self and Identity is a subfield of psychology. As the name implies, it deals with topics pertaining to both self and identity. Key areas of investigation include self-concept, self-esteem, and self-control.\nWhat distinguishes self and identity as a discipline is its scientific character. Emphasis is placed on the empirical testing of systematic theories about relevant phenomena. Hence, its methodological approach differs from both philosophy and sociology.\nSelf and Identity incorporates elements from different areas of psychology. However, it owes particularly large debt to personality psychology and social psychology.\n\n\n== Individual level analysis of the self ==\nThere are levels of analysis that one can look at self and identity. One level of analysis is the self on the individual level, for example, self-states, self-motives, self-esteem, self-efficacy, etc. Self-states are self-process that include unbiased self-awareness. However, self-motives are more serious impulses to action, something that is innate and societal or cultural analysis of the self.\nThe other level of analysis is on the societal or cultural level, for example, the cultural conception of a person, cultural arrangements that make the person who they are and the cultural concept of self.Self and identity are highly contingent upon culture. In industrialized Western cultures, the concept of self is based solely on independence.\n\n\n== Collective Self-Esteem ==\nThe attitude towards social groups has an effect on the individuals self-esteem towards their own group along with other groups. The collective self-esteem that is gathered from each group depends on how they're being treated. If the individual has a low self-esteem, the outlook on other groups can be negative and bonds with other groups can be difficult to manifest in the future. The way minority groups treat each other has this kind of effect within the group while treating other groups negatively depending on the individuals experiences with that group. Despite these group differences, some individuals who have a positive perspective of other minority groups can increase the individuals collective self-esteem, which can progress to what is called cross-group friendships. Cross-group friendships can be described as a positive relationship between the intergroup also referred to as cross-race friendship. \"

"Computational_materials_science| Computational science| Computational physics| ","Computational materials science and engineering uses modeling, simulation, theory, and informatics to understand materials. The main goals include discovering new materials, determining material behavior and mechanisms, explaining experiments, and exploring materials theories. It is analogous to computational chemistry and computational biology as an increasingly important subfield of materials science.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nJust as materials science spans all length scales, from electrons to components, so do its computational sub-disciplines. While many methods and variations have been and continue to be developed, seven main simulation techniques, or motifs, have emerged.These computer simulation methods use underlying models and approximations to understand material behavior in more complex scenarios than pure theory generally allows and with more detail and precision than is often possible from experiments. Each method can be used independently to predict materials properties and mechanisms, to feed information to other simulation methods run separately or concurrently, or to directly compare or contrast with experimental results.One notable sub-field of computational materials science is integrated computational materials engineering (ICME), which seeks to use computational results and methods in conjunction with experiments, with a focus on industrial and commercial application. Major current themes in the field include uncertainty quantification and propagation throughout simulations for eventual decision making, data infrastructure for sharing simulation inputs and results, high-throughput materials design and discovery, and new approaches given significant increases in computing power and the continuing history of supercomputing.\n\n\n== Materials simulation methods ==\n\n\n=== Electronic structure ===\n\nElectronic structure methods solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to calculate the energy of a system of electrons and atoms, the fundamental units of condensed matter. \nMany variations of electronic structure methods exist of varying computational complexity, with a range of trade-offs between speed and accuracy.\n\n\n==== Density functional theory ====\n\nDue to its balance of computational cost and predictive capability density functional theory (DFT) has the most significant use in materials science. DFT most often refers to the calculation of the lowest energy state of the system; however, molecular dynamics (atomic motion through time) can be run with DFT computing forces between atoms.\nWhile DFT and many other electronic structures methods are described as ab initio, there are still approximations and inputs. Within DFT there are increasingly complex, accurate, and slow approximations underlying the simulation because the exact exchange-correlation functional is not known. The simplest model is the Local-density approximation (LDA), becoming more complex with the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) and beyond. \nAn additional common approximation is to use a pseudopotential in place of core electrons, significantly speeding up simulations.\n\n\n=== Atomistic methods ===\nThis section discusses the two major atomic simulation methods in materials science. Other particle-based methods include material point method and particle-in-cell, most often used for solid mechanics and plasma physics, respectively.\n\n\n==== Molecular dynamics ====\n\nThe term Molecular dynamics (MD) is the historical name used to classify simulations of classical atomic motion through time. Typically, interactions between atoms are defined and fit to both experimental and electronic structure data with a wide variety of models, called interatomic potentials. With the interactions prescribed (forces), Newtonian motion is numerically integrated. The forces for MD can also be calculated using electronic structure methods based on either the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation or  Car-Parrinello approaches.\nThe simplest models include only van der Waals type attractions and steep repulsion to keep atoms apart, the nature of these models are derived from dispersion forces. Increasingly more complex models include effects due to  coulomb interactions (e.g. ionic charges in ceramics),  covalent bonds and angles (e.g. polymers), and  electronic charge density (e.g. metals). Some models use fixed bonds, defined at the start of the simulation, while others have dynamic bonding. More recent efforts strive for robust, transferable models with generic functional forms: spherical harmonics, Gaussian kernels, and neural networks. In addition, MD can be used to simulate groupings of atoms within generic particles, called coarse-grained modeling, e.g. creating one particle per monomer within a polymer.\n\n\n==== kinetic Monte Carlo ====\n\nMonte Carlo in the context of materials science most often refers to atomistic simulations relying on rates. In kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) rates for all possible changes within the system are defined and probabilistically evaluated. Because there is no restriction of directly integrating motion (as in molecular dynamics), kMC methods are able to simulate significantly different problems with much longer timescales.\n\n\n=== Mesoscale methods ===\nThe methods listed here are among the most common and the most directly tied to materials science specifically, where atomistic and electronic structure calculations are also widely used in computational chemistry and computational biology and continuum level simulations are common in a wide array of computational science application domains.\nOther methods within materials science include cellular automata for solidification and grain growth, Potts model approaches for grain evolution and other Monte Carlo techniques, as well as direct simulation of grain structures analogous to dislocation dynamics.\n\n\n==== Dislocation dynamics ====\nPlastic deformation in metals is dominated by the movement of dislocations, which are crystalline defects in materials with line type character. Rather than simulating the movement of tens of billions of atoms to model plastic deformation, which would be prohibitively computationally expensive, discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulates the movement of dislocation lines. The overall goal of dislocation dynamics is to determine the movement of a set of dislocations given their initial positions, and external load and interacting microstructure. From this, macroscale deformation behavior can be extracted from the movement of individual dislocations by theories of plasticity. \nA typical DDD simulation goes as follows. A dislocation line can be modelled as a set of nodes connected by segments. This is similar to a mesh used in finite element modelling. Then, the forces on each of the nodes of the dislocation are calculated. These forces include any externally applied forces, forces due to the dislocation interacting with itself or other dislocations, forces from obstacles such as solutes or precipitates, and the drag force on the dislocation due to its motion, which is proportional to its velocity. The general method behind a DDD simulation is to calculate the forces on a dislocation at each of its nodes, from which the velocity of the dislocation at its nodes can be extracted. Then, the dislocation is moved forward according to this velocity and a given timestep. This procedure is then repeated. Over time, the dislocation may encounter enough obstacles such that it can no longer move and its velocity is near zero, at which point the simulation can be stopped and a new experiment can be conducted with this new dislocation arrangement.\nBoth small-scale and large-scale dislocation simulations exist. For example, 2D dislocation models have been used to model the glide of a dislocation through a single plane as it interacts with various obstacles, such as precipitates. This further captures phenomena such as  shearing and bowing  of precipitates. The drawback to 2D DDD simulations is that phenomena involving movement out of a glide plane cannot be captured, such as cross slip and climb, although they are easier to run computationally. Small 3D DDD simulations have been used to simulate phenomena such as dislocation multiplication at Frank-Read sources, and larger simulations can capture work hardening in a metal with many dislocations, which interact with each other and can multiply. A number of 3D DDD codes exist, such as ParaDiS, microMegas, and MDDP, among others. \nThere are other methods for simulating dislocation motion, from full molecular dynamics simulations, continuum dislocation dynamics, and phase field models.\n\n\n==== Phase field ====\n\nPhase field methods are focused on phenomena dependent on interfaces and interfacial motion. Both the free energy function and the kinetics (mobilities) are defined in order to propagate the interfaces within the system through time.\n\n\n==== Crystal plasticity ====\n\nCrystal plasticity simulates the effects of atomic-based, dislocation motion without directly resolving either. Instead, the crystal orientations are updated through time with elasticity theory, plasticity through yield surfaces, and hardening laws. In this way, the stress-strain behavior of a material can be determined.\n\n\n=== Continuum simulation ===\n\n\n==== Finite element method ====\n\nFinite element methods divide systems in space and solve the relevant physical equations throughout that decomposition. This ranges from thermal, mechanical, electromagnetic, to other physical phenomena. It is important to note from a materials science perspective that continuum methods generally ignore material heterogeneity and assume local materials properties to be identical throughout the system.\n\n\n== Materials modeling methods ==\nAll of the simulation methods described above contain models of materials behavior. The exchange-correlation functional for density functional theory, interatomic potential for molecular dynamics, and free energy functional for phase field simulations are examples. The degree to which each simulation method is sensitive to changes in the underlying model can be drastically different. Models themselves are often directly useful for materials science and engineering, not only to run a given simulation.\n\n\n=== CALPHAD ===\n\nPhase diagrams are integral to materials science and the development computational phase diagrams stands as one of the most important and successful examples of ICME. The Calculation of PHase Diagram (CALPHAD) method does not generally speaking constitute a simulation, but the models and optimizations instead result in phase diagrams to predict phase stability, extremely useful in materials design and materials process optimization.\n\n\n== Comparison of methods ==\nFor each material simulation method, there is a fundamental unit, characteristic length and time scale, and associated model(s).\n\n\n== Multi-scale simulation ==\n\nMany of the methods described can be combined together, either running simultaneously or separately, feeding information between length scales or accuracy levels.\n\n\n=== Concurrent multi-scale ===\nConcurrent simulations in this context means methods used directly together, within the same code, with the same time step, and with direct mapping between the respective fundamental units.\nOne type of concurrent multiscale simulation is quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM). This involves running a small portion (often a molecule or protein of interest) with a more accurate electronic structure calculation and surrounding it with a larger region of fast running, less accurate classical molecular dynamics. Many other methods exist, such as atomistic-continuum simulations, similar to QM/MM except using molecular dynamics and the finite element method as the fine (high-fidelity) and coarse (low-fidelity), respectively.\n\n\n=== Hierarchical multi-scale ===\nHierarchical simulation refers to those which directly exchange information between methods, but are run in separate codes, with differences in length and/or time scales handled through statistical or interpolative techniques.\nA common method of accounting for crystal orientation effects together with geometry embeds crystal plasticity within finite element simulations.\n\n\n=== Model development ===\nBuilding a materials model at one scale often requires information from another, lower scale. Some examples are included here.\nThe most common scenario for classical molecular dynamics simulations is to develop the interatomic model directly using density functional theory, most often electronic structure calculations. Classical MD can therefore be considered a hierarchical multi-scale technique, as well as a coarse-grained method (ignoring electrons). Similarly, coarse grained molecular dynamics are reduced or simplified particle simulations directly trained from all-atom MD simulations. These particles can represent anything from carbon-hydrogen pseudo-atoms, entire polymer monomers, to powder particles.\nDensity functional theory is also often used to train and develop CALPHAD-based phase diagrams.\n\n\n== Software and tools ==\n\nEach modeling and simulation method has a combination of commercial, open-source, and lab-based codes. Open source software is becoming increasingly common, as are community codes which combine development efforts together. Examples include Quantum ESPRESSO (DFT), LAMMPS (MD), ParaDIS (DD), FiPy (phase field), and MOOSE (Continuum). In addition, open software from other communities is often useful for materials science, e.g. GROMACS developed within computational biology.\n\n\n== Conferences ==\nAll major materials science conferences include computational research. Focusing entirely on computational efforts, the TMS ICME World Congress meets biannually. The Gordon Research Conference on Computational Materials Science and Engineering began in 2020. Many other method specific smaller conferences are also regularly organized.\n\n\n== Journals ==\nMany materials science journals, as well as those from related disciplines welcome computational materials research. Those dedicated to the field include Computational Materials Science, Modelling and Simulation in Materials Science and Engineering, and npj Computational Materials.\n\n\n== Related fields ==\nComputational materials science is one sub-discipline of both computational science and computational engineering, containing significant overlap with computational chemistry and computational physics. In addition, many atomistic methods are common between computational chemistry, computational biology, and CMSE; similarly, many continuum methods overlap with many other fields of computational engineering.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTMS World Congress on Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME)\nnanoHUB computational materials resources"

Inisheer and Eeragh both became operational in 1857.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first lighthouse on the Aran Islands was built in 1818 on Inishmore near Dun Oghil, but it became apparent that it was poorly positioned. Firstly, because it could not be seen at the hazardous ends of the Aran Islands chain, where the North and South Sound approaches were located, and secondly, its location on the highest point of the island also meant it could be obscured in poor weather conditions. Requests from the Revenue Commissioners to the Ballast Board, the predecessor of the Commissioners of Irish Lights to relocate the light went unheeded.But in 1850 the Galway Harbour Commissioners asked the Board to construct a new lighthouse at the north-west end of the islands. To meet this request, it was determined that the best approach was to construct two lighthouses, one on Inisheer and the other, the Eeragh Lighthouse, on one of the Brannock Islands to the north-west of Inishmore.The design of both lights was carried out by George Halpin Junior with construction starting in 1853. They were commissioned on 1 December 1857, with the Inishmore light being deactivated on the same date. The Inisheer Lighthouse had a first order optic, supplied by Chance Brothers of Birmingham that emitted a fixed white light with a red sector signalling the Finnis reef.Daniel Crowe & Sons of Dublin constructed both lighthouses and associated buildings, the cost for Eeragh was \u00a315,126.1s.7d. (equivalent to \u00a31,475,258 as of 2020) with Inisheer being \u00a314,252.2s.4d (equivalent to \u00a31,390,015 as of 2020)In 1913, an incandescent lamp powered by paraffin was installed and its characteristic changed from a fixed light to one that flashed every ten seconds. Inisheer was automated and electrified in 1978, but retained the Chance optics from 1913. In 2014 the optic was replaced by an LED light, with a slightly reduced range.\n\n\n== Operation ==\n\nThe optic is located at a height of 34 metres (112 ft), within a lantern room at the top of a limestone tower which has been painted white with a broad central black band. The two keeper's houses are built close by, but the light is now maintained by an attendant living some distance away, who monitors the equipment via a radio link.With a focal height of 34 metres (112 ft) above the sea, the light from the first order Fresnel lens could be seen for 20 nautical miles in the case of white light and 16 nautical miles for the red light. With the installation of the LED light, this has reduced to 18 and 11 nautical miles respectively.The light characteristic is now slightly different from that of 1913, the light emits a white or red light, depending on the direction, in isophase of 12 seconds, that is, it is illuminated for six seconds and darkened during other six. It emits red light in the sector between 245 \u00b0 and 269 \u00b0.\nIn addition, the lighthouse is equipped with a radar or RACON beacon that emits the letter K in Morse code with a range of 13 nautical miles.\n\n\n== Listed buildings ==\nThe lighthouse tower and the two keeper\u2019s houses are all listed within the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, where it is noted \"

"Gaul| Gaul| Historical regions| ","Gaul (Latin: Gallia) was a region of Western Europe first described by the Romans. It was inhabited by Celtic and Aquitani tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, and parts of Northern Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany, particularly the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 494,000 km2 (191,000 sq mi). According to Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica, and Aquitania.\nArchaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La T\u00e8ne culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia, and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC.\nDuring the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 204 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC.\nRoman control of Gaul lasted for five centuries, until the last Roman rump state, the Domain of Soissons, fell to the Franks in AD 486. \nWhile the Celtic Gauls had lost their original identities and language during Late Antiquity, becoming amalgamated into a Gallo-Roman culture, Gallia remained the conventional name of the territory throughout the Early Middle Ages, until it acquired a new identity as the Capetian Kingdom of France in the high medieval period. Gallia remains a name of France in modern Greek (\u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b1) and modern Latin (besides the alternatives Francia and Francogallia).\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe Greek and Latin names Galatia (first attested by Timaeus of Tauromenium in the 4th century BC) and Gallia are ultimately derived from a Celtic ethnic term or clan Gal(a)-to-. The Galli of Gallia Celtica were reported to refer to themselves as Celtae by Caesar. Hellenistic folk etymology connected the name of the Galatians (\u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, Gal\u00e1tai) to the supposedly \"

From there, the film was distributed straight to cable television and rights to it were acquired by Starz.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nBruno Battaglia is a young boy attending an American Roman Catholic school. Bruno's estranged father Dino, a police officer, left the family long ago and Bruno lives with his mother Angela. Angela is overweight and dresses flamboyantly in outfits that she designs and makes herself, standing out in stark contrast to the rest of their conservative Italian American neighborhood.\nWhile competing in advancing levels of the Catholic school spelling bee, Bruno decides to start wearing dresses. He wears them as a source of empowerment as well as feeling the need to express himself. He often identifies with angels and, when challenged that he can't wear a dress to the spelling bee championship in Vatican City, Bruno points out that even the Pope wears a dress. For his choice in outfits, Bruno receives heavy criticism from fellow students and faculty, especially the school's Mother Superior as well as becoming a target of the school's bullies. Initially supported only by his best friend Shawniqua, as he progresses further in the spelling competition, his choices of self-expression eventually become accepted by his peers and his superiors. Bruno wins the spelling bee competition and meets the Pope. With the help of his grandmother, Helen, Bruno also begins to form a bond with Dino who, in turn, is inspired by his son to pursue his long abandoned childhood dream of becoming an opera singer, despite previously being unwilling to accept his son, even leaving the room before Bruno sings in a dress.\n\n\n== Cast and characters ==\nAlex D.

He served as the Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner from 2004 to 2012 and was the running mate of David L. Williams in the 2011 gubernatorial election. After leaving office, Farmer was investigated for violating state campaign finance laws and misappropriating state resources and was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison along with a concurrent 12 months in state prison.\nA point guard, Farmer led Clay County High School to the 1987 Kentucky High School Athletic Association (KHSAA) State Basketball Championship and, in 1988, was named Kentucky Mr. Basketball and Kentucky Associated Press Male High School Athlete of the Year after setting a championship game record with 51 points in a losing effort. Although he was popular state-wide and publicly stated his desire to play collegiate basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats, Coach Eddie Sutton was reluctant to offer Farmer a scholarship. After Farmer announced that he would visit other colleges and issued a deadline past which he would no longer consider Kentucky without a scholarship offer, Sutton relented and Farmer joined the University of Kentucky.\nKentucky struggled during Farmer's first year, finishing with a 13\u201319 record, and by mid-season, fans were accusing Sutton of unfairly favoring his son, Sean, over Farmer at the point guard position. Sutton resigned in the offseason due to a pay-for-play scandal for which the NCAA banned Kentucky from postseason play for two years. Sutton's replacement, Rick Pitino, instituted a rigorous conditioning program and fast-paced style of play that improved Farmer's performance. After spending his junior season as a backup to Sean Woods, Farmer transitioned to shooting guard and became a starter in the middle of his senior year. Again eligible for postseason competition, the Wildcats won the Southeastern Conference tournament and reached the Regional Finals of the 1992 NCAA Tournament, losing in overtime on a last-second shot by Duke's Christian Laettner in a game regarded by many as the greatest college basketball game ever played.

"Eeltail_catfish| Plotosidae| Taxa named by Pieter Bleeker| ","The eeltail catfish are a family (Plotosidae) of catfish whose tails are elongated in an eel-like fashion. These catfishes are native to the Indian Ocean and western Pacific from Japan to Australia and Fiji. The family includes about 41 species in 10 genera. About half of the species are freshwater, occurring in Australia and New Guinea.These fish have eel-like bodies. Their tails are pointed or bluntly rounded. Most species have four pairs of barbels. The adipose fin is absent. The tail fin is formed by the joining of the second dorsal fin, the caudal fin, and the anal fin, forming a single, continuous fin.Some of these catfishes can inflict painful wounds; stings from Plotosus lineatus may cause death, however stings from other types of eeltail catfish causes stinging which usually resides up to two weeks from when the person was penetrated by its dorsal spines. They are bottom feeders and use the barbels around their mouths to detect food.Unlike most marine teleosts, eeltails have an extra-branchial salt-secreting dendritic organ for osmoregulation. The dendritic organ is likely a product of convergent evolution with other vertebrate salt-secreting organs. The role of this organ was discovered by its high NKA and NKCC activity in response to increasing salinity. However, the Plotosidae dendritic organ may be of limited use under extreme salinity conditions, compared to more typical gill-based ionoregulation.\n\n\n== References =="

Leveson Gower&#039;s XI cricketers| North v South cricketers| Northamptonshire cricketers| Penarth RFC players| Royal Air Force cricketers| Rugby union players from Penarth| Welsh cricketers| Welsh male table tennis players| Welsh rugby union players| ","Austin David George Matthews  (3 May 1904 \u2013 29 July 1977) was a cricketer who played for Northamptonshire, Glamorgan and England.\n\n\n== Cricketing career ==\nBorn 3 May 1904 in Penarth, Glamorgan, Austin Matthews began playing cricket at a young age with the Cardiff club and with a natural height advantage he showed promise both as a fast-medium bowler and a hard-hitting batsman. However, from 1926 he moved to Northampton and thus became qualified for Northamptonshire. Competing for a place with Nobby Clark and medium-pacer Albert Thomas, Matthews played fairly frequently in 1928 and regularly from 1929 but in fact in these initial years fared better as a batsman than bowler, hitting 116 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston and falling only 45 short of a four-figure aggregate \u2013 which in fact placed him fourth in batting for the county. However, in 1930 he did not reach fifty, and subsequently his batting declined to the point that from 1935 he did not once reach fifty and was regarded purely as a bowler. Although Matthews took 93 wickets in the dry summer of 1933 and formed one of the better new ball bowling partnerships with Clark, his very poor record in 1935 suggested his talent lacked depth. However, in 1936, as Northamptonshire moved into the deepest abyss of form of any county side, Wisden said that \u201cFor sheer consistency, Matthews stood alone\u201d and that he had had one of his best seasons for the County.Then in 1937, Matthews became coach at Stowe School and was not expected to play any first-class cricket. However, when Jack Mercer was injured, Maurice Turnbull asked him to help Glamorgan and he accepted. In Matthews\u2019 third match for the county, he took fourteen Sussex wickets for 132 runs on a batsman's pitch at Hastings, and two weeks later was a controversial choice for the third Test match against New Zealand at The Oval, making his debut alongside Denis Compton. He took two wickets (Walter Hadlee in both innings), made two runs and took one catch, and was never picked again. However, in contrast to his average of 26.53 in ten seasons for Northamptonshire, Matthews in 1937 headed the first-class bowling averages and came close to repeating this feat in 1938 and 1946, when he equalled his 1933 haul of 93 wickets and took seven for twelve on a treacherous pitch against Somerset.For Glamorgan, Austin Matthews took 225 wickets at the low average of 15.88 runs per wicket, and after World War II he also coached Cambridge University. In later years he occasionally wrote for cricket publications because of his strong criticism of post-war coaching methods.\n\n\n== Other sports ==\nAn all-round sportsman, Matthews played rugby union for Penarth RFC and later Northampton RFC. In 1929, during his time with Penarth, Matthews was a final Welsh rugby trialist and his cap is held in the Penarth Club's archive. Matthews captained Northampton RFC between 1935 and 1937. His Northampton cap is also lodged with the Penarth RFC archive together with the cap gained by Matthews' father, Frederick, as a final Welsh rugby trialist in 1896. Matthews also represented Wales at table tennis.\nHe died 29 July 1977 in Penrhyn Bay, Llandudno, Caernarvonshire.\n\n\n== References =="

The film is an adaptation of the 1959 stage musical of the same name, composed by Richard Rodgers with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. The film's screenplay was written by Ernest Lehman, adapted from the stage musical's book by Lindsay and Crouse. Based on the 1949 memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria von Trapp, the film is about a young Austrian postulant in Salzburg, Austria, in 1938 who is sent to the villa of a retired naval officer and widower to be governess to his seven children. After bringing love and music into the lives of the family, she marries the officer and, together with the children, finds a way to survive the loss of their homeland to the Nazis.\nFilming took place from March to September 1964 in Los Angeles and Salzburg. The Sound of Music was released on March 2, 1965, in the United States, initially as a limited roadshow theatrical release. Although initial critical response to the film was mixed, it was a major commercial success, becoming the number one box office film after four weeks, and the highest-grossing film of 1965. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all-time\u2014surpassing Gone with the Wind\u2014and held that distinction for five years.

"Chicken_Fran%C3%A7aise| American chicken dishes| Italian-American cuisine| Culture of Rochester, New York| Cuisine of New York (state)| ","Chicken Fran\u00e7aise (or Chicken Francese) is an Italian-American dish of flour-dredged, egg-dipped, saut\u00e9ed chicken cutlets with a lemon-butter and white wine sauce. The dish is popular in the region surrounding Rochester, New York, where it is known as Chicken French, to the point that some have suggested the dish be called Chicken Rochester. When Italian immigrants arrived in Rochester, they brought their recipes with them, including veal francese, but they substituted chicken for the more expensive veal.  \nAnother source says that Veal Francese had been popular in the region since the 1950s, but when consumers boycotted veal in the 1970s, area chefs like James Cianciola of the Brown Derby Restaurant successfully substituted chicken. Cianciola credits chefs Tony Mammano and Joe Cairo with bringing the dish from New York City.Despite being such a well-known dish in Italian-American culture, francese is not a classical dish or sauce. There are no written recipes that mark the origin of this dish.Artichokes French is a common variation using artichoke hearts instead of chicken. Artichokes French is often served as an appetizer.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPiccata\nList of chicken dishes\nItalian-American cuisine\n\n\n== References =="

"Aviculture| Aviculture| Bird conservation| ","Aviculture is the practice of keeping and breeding birds, especially of wild birds in captivity.\n\n\n== Types ==\nThere are various reasons that people get involved in aviculture. Some people breed birds to preserve a species. Some people breed parrots as companion birds, and some people breed birds to make a profit.\n\n\n=== Aviculture ===\nAviculture is the practice of keeping birds (class Aves) in captivity using controlled conditions, normally within the confines of an aviary, for hobby, business, research and conservation purposes. Some reasons for aviculture are: breeding birds to preserve the species because many avian species are at risk due to habitat destruction and natural disaster. Aviculture encourages conservation, provides education about avian species, provides companion birds for the public, and includes research on avian behaviour.\n\n\n== Publications and avicultural societies ==\nPublications on aviculture include books on species which include pets, books on breeding and introductory books for parrots and softbills. There are also periodicals, both generalized and specific to types of birds, with articles on breeding, care, companionship, choosing a bird, and health effects. Supply companies publish catalogs of products for bird keepers.\nThere are avicultural societies throughout the world, but generally in Europe, Australia and the United States, where people tend to be more prosperous, having more leisure time to invest. In the UK, the Avicultural Society was formed in 1894 and the Foreign Bird League in 1932.The oldest avicultural society in the United States is the Avicultural Society of America, founded in 1927. The ASA produces a bi-monthly magazine, ASA Avicultural Bulletin. The ASA is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that focuses on breeding, conservation, restoration and education.\nThe first avicultural society in Australia was The Avicultural Society of South Australia, founded in 1928. It is now promoted with the name Bird Keeping in Australia. The two major national avicultural societies in the United States are the American Federation of Aviculture and the Avicultural Society of America, founded in 1927. The Budgerigar Society was formed in 1925.\nThe Avicultural Society of South Australia (founded in 1928) produces a monthly full-colour magazine, Bird Keeping in Australia.\n\n\n== Sub-branches ==\n\n\n=== Canariculture ===\nFrom the common name canary (associated with the Serinus canaria), a song bird is native to the Canary Islands, Madeira, and the Azores. This bird has been kept as a cagebird in Europe from the 1470s to the present, now enjoying an international following. The terms canariculture and canaricultura have been used in French, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian respectively, to describe the keeping and breeding of canaries for some time. English speaking canary breeders are beginning to use the term more commonly.\n\n\n=== Psittaculture ===\nThe word comes from the psittacinae (Latin psittacinus, for parrot, from Greek psittakos).\nPsittaculture is a word that has been used in the aviculture community since the early 1970s, to denote people who specialize in keeping, breeding and conserving psittacines species, also on preserving psittacines habitat and public awareness campaigns to save wild parrots.

"Vieja_melanurus| Vieja| Fish of Central America| Taxa named by Albert Günther| Fish described in 1862| Cichlidae stubs| ","Vieja melanurus, the quetzal cichlid, redhead cichlid or firehead cichlid, is a species of cichlid that is native to the Lake Pet\u00e9n system, the Grijalva\u2013Usumacinta River basin and other Atlantic river drainages in southern Mexico, Belize and Guatemala, with introduced populations in a few other countries. It typically inhabits slow-moving or standing waters such as rivers, lakes and lagoons; although primarily a freshwater fish, it may occur in slightly brackish habitats. It is popular in the aquarium trade, where often listed under the synonym V. synspila/synspilum. It is almost entirely herbivorous, but may also take small animal prey.V. melanurus can reach a total length of 35 cm (14 in). Males grow larger than females and also develop a prominent nuchal hump on their forehead. Adults are quite colourful cichlids with an orange to pinkish-red head, a body often displaying greenish, bluish, pink and golden-orange, and a horizontal black bar (often patchy or mottled) at the base of the tail; the belly and mottling elsewhere on the body can also black. There are significant individual and geographical variations in the colours; partially, this is related to the clarity of the water at a location. Adults are always robust and high-bodies cichlids, but there are some regional variations depending on habitat.It has been used in creating new hybridized aquarium cichlids that became popular in Asia in recent years and is probably one of the parents of modern blood parrot cichlids and flowerhorn cichlids.\n\n\n== References =="

"Immaculate_Conception_Roman_Catholic_Church_(Northern_Liberties),_Philadelphia| Roman Catholic churches in Pennsylvania| Roman Catholic churches in Philadelphia| Irish-American culture in Philadelphia| Northern Liberties, Philadelphia| ","The Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic Church is located at Front and Allen Streets in Philadelphia, PA 19123 in the Northern Liberties, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania section of the city; after over 140 years as an independent parish, it became a worship site of the adjacent St. Michael's parish in 2011. The parish celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2019, having been founded in 1869 under the leadership of Bishop James Frederick Wood. Twenty-five years earlier, two Catholic parishes within about a mile of the church\u2014St. Augustine Church, Philadelphia at 4th and Vine and St. Michael [1] at 2nd and Jefferson\u2014were burnt to the ground in violent anti-Catholic nativist riots.   The church continued as an independent parish or as a worship site for almost 150 years until, in the fall of 2019, it was announced that the church building would be closed permanently.\n\n\n== Founding and History through End of 20th Century ==\nAt the time of its founding, the area surrounding the church was largely composed of row houses which were home to Irish immigrants (although the ground for the church complex itself had earlier housed a spoke factory at Front and Canal (now Allen) Streets). Later the area became industrialized through the early part of the twentieth century.\nIn the early 1970s, much of it was gutted by the construction of Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania which emptied five blocks in the parish of houses and caused the demolition of houses on many other blocks in the way of the road. In the early part of the 21st century the area began to undergo a continuing process of gentrification with thousands of newly constructed and rehabilitated housing units as well as an increased workforce with the arrival, about three blocks from the church, of the SugarHouse Casino which anticipates an ultimate workforce of 1,500 full and part time positions and is planning an onsite hotel. (As for housing, the local Northern Liberties Neighborhood Association estimates an increase of close to 10,000 new residents in the area since 2000.)\n\n\n== Twinning of Parish with St. Michael ==\nIn the spring of 2000, Immaculate Conception was twinned with St. Michael's parish (two of the 22 parishes twinned at the time) and a single pastor was appointed for both churches.   In 2010, a former parochial vicar at the parish, the then-Msgr. Michael J. Fitzgerald, was ordained an auxiliary bishop for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.\n\n\n== Suppression of Parish: Continuation of Church as Worship Site ==\n\nIn February 2011, it was announced by the then-parochial administrator, Reverend Eugene C. Wilson, and the Vicar for the Philadelphia-South portion of the Archdiocese, Monsignor Kevin Lawrence, that the status of the church would be changed from that of a twinned parish to that of a worship site of St. Michael's; this means that, while the church would be used for Sunday Masses, and occasional sacramental celebrations, such as weddings, funerals and baptisms, it would no longer be an independent parish. This change was completed as of July 1, 2011.\nIn December, 2017, the Masses were discontinued because of continuing problems with the heating system and were then moved to St. Michael church.   Since then Mass has not been held on a regular basis at Immaculate, although a Mass was celebrated on the Feast of the Assumption 2018.\nImmediately prior to its suppression, the parish boundaries encompassed the area from Delaware River at Susquehanna Ave. south to Green St. then west to 3rd St., north to Girard Ave. and east to Susquehanna Ave. to Delaware River. Any Catholic living in this area would normally have been a member of the parish. In addition to the portion of the parish in Northern Liberties, much of it was in Fishtown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Following the suppression of Immaculate Conception Parish, this territory was added to that in which residents were already considered parishioners of St. Michael Parish.\n\n\n== Closure of the Church Building ==\nLess than two months before its 150th anniversary and about fourteen months after the last Mass was celebrated in the building on August 15, 2018 (for the Feast of the Assumption), it was announced, in October 2019, that the building would be closed and no longer used as a church.  The reasons given were that the building, without a working heating system for several years, had deteriorated to the point where it was unsafe for public use and the cost of remediating the problems was prohibitive, far beyond the means of the small congregation of under 100 people active in the parish.\nIn light of this, a process to relegate the church building to allow it to be used for profane  was to be undertaken.\nA final prayer event to mark the closing of the building was held on the 150th anniversary of the church's dedication, December 8, 2019, when a prayer service including the Rosary was to be held outside the building with a group of former parishioners.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe parish designated St. Michael School as its parochial grade school.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nListing of Parish on Archdiocesan Web Site\nMap and Photo of Church from Google Maps\nPhotos of interior of building on Philly Church Project\nProcedures for relegation of unused Catholic churches [2]"

"Dynamic_scoring| Economic forecasting| Fiscal policy| ","Dynamic scoring is a forecasting technique for government revenues, expenditures, and budget deficits that incorporates predictions about the behavior of people and organizations based on changes in fiscal policy, usually tax rates. Dynamic scoring depends on models of the behavior of economic agents which predict how they would react once the tax rate or other policy change goes into effect. This means the uncertainty induced in predictions is greater to the degree that the proposed policy is unlike current policy. Unfortunately, any such model depends heavily on judgment, and there is no evidence that it is more effective or accurate.For example, a dynamic scoring model may include econometric model of a transitional phase as the population adapts to the new policy, rather than the so-called static-scoring alternative of standard assumption about behavior of people being immediately and directly sensitive to prices. The outcome of the dynamic analysis is therefore heavily dependent on assumptions about future behaviors and rates of change. The dynamic analysis is potentially more accurate than the alternative, if the econometric model correctly captures how households and firms will react to a policy changes.  This has been attacked as assumption-driven compared to static scoring which makes simpler assumptions about behavior change due to the introduction of a new policy.\n\n\n== United States national government, 2015-2018 ==\nUsing dynamic scoring has been promoted by Republican legislators to argue that supply-side tax policy, for example the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2011 GOP Path to Prosperity proposal, return higher benefits in terms of GDP growth and revenue increases than are predicted from static scoring.  Some economists argue that their dynamic scoring conclusions are overstated, pointing out that CBO practices already include some dynamic scoring elements and that to include more may lead to politicization of the department.On January 6, 2013, the version of the Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013 included in the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 passed the United States House of Representatives as part of their Rules adopted in House Resolution 5, passed with the exclusive support of the Republican Party (United States) by a vote of 234-172.  The same rules package for the year had other controversial provisions funded. The bill will require the Congressional Budget Office to use dynamic scoring to provide a macroeconomic impact analysis for bills that are estimated to have a large budgetary effect. The text of the provision reads:\n\n(a) An estimate provided by the Congressional Budget Office under section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 for any major legislation shall, to the extent practicable, incorporate the budgetary effects of changes in economic output, employment, capital stock, and other macroeconomic variables  resulting from such legislation.\n(b) An estimate provided by the Joint Committee on Taxation to the  Director of the Congressional Budget Office under section 201(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 for any major legislation shall, to the extent practicable, incorporate the budgetary effects of changes in economic output, employment, capital stock, and other macroeconomic variables resulting from such legislation.\n(c) An estimate referred to in this clause shall, to the extent practicable, include--\n\n(1) a qualitative assessment of the budgetary effects (including macroeconomic variables described in paragraphs (a) and (b)) of such legislation in the 20-fiscal year period beginning after the last fiscal year of the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget that set forth appropriate levels required by section 301 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974; and(2) an identification of the critical assumptions and the source of data underlying that estimate.(d) As used in this clause--\n\n(1) the term `major legislation' means any bill or joint resolution--(A) for which an estimate is required to be prepared pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and that causes a gross budgetary effect (before incorporating macroeconomic effects) in any fiscal year over the years of the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget equal to or greater than 0.25 percent of the current projected gross domestic product of the United States for that fiscal year; or(B) designated as such by the chair of the Committee on the Budget for all direct spending legislation other than revenue legislation or the Member who is chair or vice chair, as applicable, of the Joint Committee on Taxation for revenue legislation; and(2) the term `budgetary effects' means changes in revenues, outlays, and deficits.\nThese provisions were removed in January 2019 for the 116th Congress by H.

"New_York-style_pizza| American pizza| Pizza styles| Italian-American culture in New York City| Sicilian-American cuisine| Italian-American cuisine| Pizza in New York City| ","New York\u2013style pizza is pizza made with a characteristically large hand-tossed thin crust, often sold in wide slices to go. The crust is thick and crisp only along its edge, yet soft, thin, and pliable enough beneath its toppings to be folded in half to eat. Traditional toppings are simply tomato sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese.This style evolved in the U.S. from the pizza that originated in New York City in the early 1900s, itself derived from the Neapolitan-style pizza made in Italy. Today it is the dominant style eaten in the New York metropolitan area states of New York, and New Jersey and variously popular throughout the United States. Regional variations exist throughout the Northeast and elsewhere in the U.S.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first pizzeria in the United States, Lombardi's, was founded by Gennaro Lombardi in New York City's Little Italy in 1905, though this has recently been challenged by author Peter Regas. An immigrant pizzaiolo (pizza maker) from Naples, he opened a grocery store in 1897; eight years later, it was licensed to sell pizza by New York State. An employee, Antonio Totonno Pero, began making pizza, which sold for five cents a pie. Many people, however, could not afford a whole pie and instead would offer what they could in return for a corresponding sized slice, which was wrapped in paper tied with string. In 1924, Totonno left Lombardi's to open his own pizzeria on Coney Island, called Totonno's.\nThe original pizzerias in New York used coal-fired ovens and baked their pizza with the cheese on the bottom and sauce on top.\nBy 2010, over 400 pizza restaurants existed in New York City, with hundreds more of varied cuisine also offering the dish.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nNew York\u2013style pizza is traditionally hand-tossed, consisting in its basic form of a light layer of tomato sauce sprinkled with dry, grated, full-fat mozzarella cheese; additional toppings are placed over the cheese. Pies are typically around 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60 cm) in diameter, and commonly cut into eight slices. These large wide slices are often eaten as fast food while folded in half along the crust both for convenience \u2013 allowing the slice to be eaten one-handed \u2013 and to control the flow of oil running off the pie in both directions.\nNew York\u2013style pizza gets its distinguishing crust from the high-gluten bread flour with which it is made. Minerals present in New York City's tap water supply are also credited with giving the dough in metro area pies its characteristic texture and flavor. Some out-of-state pizza bakers even transport the water cross-country for the sake of authenticity. However, many dispute this, claiming a similarly high-quality pizza can be made elsewhere with otherwise similar techniques and ingredients.Typical condiments include dried oregano, dried red chili pepper flakes, garlic powder dried basil, and grated Parmesan cheese.\n\n\n=== Gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Regional variations ==\nNew York\u2013style pizza is most prevalent in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut, but can be found throughout the Northeastern region and beyond.

Portions of it existed until 2009.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThis area of Derbyshire had been known for its outcrops of iron ore which had been exploited at least since the Middle Ages. After the Norman Conquest, nearby Duffield Frith was the property of the de Ferrers family who were iron masters in Normandy.In 1793, William Jessop, with the assistance of Benjamin Outram, constructed the Cromford Canal to connect Pinxton and Cromford with the Erewash Canal. In digging Butterley Tunnel for the Cromford Canal, coal and iron were discovered. Fortuitously, Butterley Hall fell vacant and in 1790 Outram, with the financial assistance of Francis Beresford, bought it and its estate.\nThe following year they were joined by Jessop and John, the grandson of Ichabod Wright, a wealthy Nottingham banker who was betrothed to Beresford's daughter and who owned the Butterley Park estate.\nIn 1793 the French Revolutionary Wars broke out and by 1796 the blast furnace was producing nearly a thousand tons of pig iron a year. By the second decade of the next century the company had expanded with another works at Codnor Park in Codnor, both works then having two blast furnaces, and output had risen to around 4,500 tons per year.\n\n\n== Early years ==\n\nOutram died in 1805 and the name changed to the Butterley Company, with one of Jessop's sons, also William, taking over.\nIn 1814 the company produced the iron work for Vauxhall Bridge over the River Thames.\nThe company also owned Hilt's Quarry at Crich, which supplied limestone for the ironworks and for the limekilns at Bullbridge, providing lime for farmers and for the increasing amount of building work. The steep wagonway to the Cromford Canal at Bullbridge was called the Butterley Gangroad and incorporated the world's oldest surviving railway tunnel, at Fritchley (built 1793). In 1812, William Brunton, an engineer for the company, produced his remarkable Steam Horse locomotive\nIn 1817, in the depression following the Napoleonic Wars, the works at Butterley was the scene of the Pentrich Revolution. The intention of the rebels was to kill the three senior managers and ransack the works for weapons. When they arrived they were confronted by George Goodwin the factory agent, who, with a few constables, faced them down. There is little to be seen of the event, but the hexagonal office where Goodwin stood his ground is a listed building in the yard of the works.Following this the country entered a long period of prosperity, the company with it. In 1830 it was considered to be the largest coal owner and the second-largest iron producer in the East Midlands. By this time the company owned a considerable number of quarries for limestone and mines for coal and iron, and installed a third blast furnace at Codnor Park.\n\nOne of the two drainage engines at Pode Hole and the engine in the Pinchbeck Engine land drainage museum were built by Butterley, as were the Scoop wheel pumps.They produced a vast array of goods, from rails for wagonways to heaters for tea urns. Thomas Telford's Caledonian Canal used lock gates and machinery with castings produced at Butterley, and two steam dredgers designed by Jessop. The company also produced steam locomotives, mostly for its own use, but it provided two for the Midland Counties Railway.\nIt produced all the necessary castings for the new railways and two complete lines, the Croydon, Merstham and Godstone Iron Railway and the Cromford and High Peak Railway. A winding engine for the latter exists in working order at Middleton Top near Wirksworth.\nThe company was quick to invest in the new Bessemer process for steel manufacture in 1856, being one of four businesses that took out a licence from Sir Henry Bessemer within a month of his announcing his method. The licences were spread around the country in order to protect the trading interests of the licensees.\n\nNotable patents were taken out by the company's manager, Sir John Alleyne. In December 1859 Alleyne patented a method of producing a load-bearing iron beam known as the Butterley Bulb, used in many early iron steam ships including HMS Warrior In 1861 Alleyne patented a method that allowed hot ingots to be moved around a roller after they had passed by just one person. During the production of steel sections the bar has to be repeatedly put through rollers. Allowing this to happen using just one person was a substantial increase in productivity. By 1863 the company was rolling the largest masses of iron of any foundry in the country. Among its most famous buildings are the Barlow train shed at St Pancras station in London, which included 240-foot spans.\nAlleyne's next invention was the two high reversing steel mill patented in 1870, which used two steam engines to allow metal ingots to be repeatedly rolled to get the correct size and section. With this technique the steel did not have to be moved to re-enter the rolling process but merely had to be moved back into the rolling machine once it had passed through.\nThere was also an extensive brickworks for railways, thousands of factories and domestic dwellings.\nBy 1874 company workers were starting to fight for better conditions. The company sacked 11 miners \"

"Grantham_Canal| Canals in Lincolnshire| Canal restoration| Canals in Nottinghamshire| Canals linked to the River Trent| Grantham| Canals opened in 1797| ","The Grantham Canal ran 33 miles (53 km) from Grantham through 18 locks to West Bridgford, where it joined the River Trent. It was built primarily for the transportation of coal to Grantham. It opened in 1797 and its profitability steadily increased until 1841. It was then sold to a railway company, declined, and was finally closed in 1936. It was used as a water supply for agriculture, and so most of it remained in water after closure, although bridges were lowered. Since the 1970s, the Grantham Canal Society have been working to restore parts of it. Two stretches are now navigable to small vessels. A new route will be required where the canal joins the Trent, as road building has severed the original one.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of a canal from the River Trent to Grantham was first raised on 27 August 1791, as a way of supplying the district with cheaper coal. The intent was for the navigation to join the Trent below Nottingham at Radcliffe-on-Trent. As William Jessop was surveying the Nottingham Canal at the time, he was asked to survey the Grantham route as well, and a bill was put before Parliament in 1792. It was defeated, as there was opposition from coal suppliers, who delivered coal by road to Grantham, and from those who thought that the River Witham would be damaged by the project. A revised route was developed, with the junction now at West Bridgford, and an additional 3.6-mile (5.8 km) branch to Bingham. A second bill was put forward and the act of Parliament received the Royal Assent on 30 April 1793. Building work on the canal started in 1793, with Jessop in overall charge, but with James Green and William King as resident engineers: Green, who was from Wollaton, was appointed engineer for the section of canal from the Trent to the Leicestershire border, while King, who was the agent for the Duke of Rutland, was responsible for the rest of the canal, including two reservoirs, one at Denton and the other at Knipton on the River Devon.The act authorised an initial \u00a375,000 to be raised to pay for construction, together with an option to raise a further \u00a330,000, of which \u00a320,000 should be raised by shares of \u00a3100 each among the initial subscribers, and \u00a310,000 by mortgaging the future income of the canal. However, this amount proved insufficient, and there was also disagreement between the shareholders as to their liability to raise the additional \u00a320,000. As a result, a second act was sought. This received the Royal Assent on 3 March 1797, and made clear the obligations of existing shareholders to pay the extra subscription, and also authorised an additional \u00a324,000 to be raised. The second act also removed restrictions in the first act, and allowed the company to set whatever rates it chose for using the canal.The eastern section from the Leicestershire border was opened on 1 February 1797, with the rest of the canal later that year. The canal was built with locks 75 by 14 feet (22.9 by 4.3 m), the same size as those on the Nottingham Canal to allow boats to use both. The branch to Bingham authorised by the first act was not built. The 18 locks raised the level of the canal by 140 feet (43 m) from the Trent to Grantham. Eleven of them were in the first 4 miles (6.4 km) above the Trent, after which there was a level pound of around 20 miles (32 km) before a flight of seven locks at Woolsthorpe, and a much shorter upper pound to Grantham. At Harlaxton, the canal passed through a deep cutting (effectively crossing the watershed between the River Witham and the River Trent), which was only wide enough for a single boat, but this situation was partially rectified in 1801 when the cutting was widened in two places to allow boats travelling on opposite directions to cross. At Cropwell Bishop and Cropwell Butler, the route passed through gypsum beds, which resulted in problems with leakage.\n\n\n=== Operation ===\nThe canal made sufficient money to repay substantial debts in 1804 and 1805, after which dividends were paid to the shareholders, beginning at 2 per cent in 1806, rising to 5 per cent in 1815, and reaching their highest level of 8.6 per cent in 1839. The tolls brought in an income which remained below \u00a39,000 until 1823, but then rose steadily to reach \u00a313,079 in 1841. Traffic towards Grantham included coal and coke, lime, groceries and building materials. Some of it supplied villages along the line of the canal, and some of that which travelled the full distance was distributed by land to villages beyond Grantham. Downward traffic was largely agricultural produce, including corn, beans, malt and wool. Such produce was normally loaded at Grantham or Harby.Initially, some of the coal carried on the canal had been transported in boats owned by the canal company, but they had given up this practice in 1812. They resumed carrying coal in 1827, because they felt that coal stocks at Grantham were not adequate, but were accused of price-fixing. Although the penalty imposed by Lincoln Assizes was small, they ceased this trade, and the coal merchants agreed to maintain stocks of 2,660 tons at Grantham. In 1833, J. Rofe and his son made a proposal for a canal to connect Grantham and Sleaford, but this was not pursued.\n\n\n=== Decline ===\nIn common with most canals, competition from railways posed a major threat, and in 1845 the canal owners agreed to sell it to the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway when their line from Ambergate to Grantham was opened. Although the railway was completed in 1850, the railway company did not honour the agreement. The canal company brought a large number of cases against the railway company, and successfully opposed several bills which the railway were trying to get passed in Parliament. Eventually the railway company agreed to pay, and shareholders received \u00a345 per share in cash, with the balance being in railway mortgages. The agreement was reached on 1 June 1854, and the transfer of ownership took place on 20 December. Railway mergers meant that the canal came under the control of the Great Northern Railway in 1861, and later the London and North Eastern Railway.Traffic declined as the railway companies neglected the canal, and were down to 18,802 tons in 1905, on which the tolls amounted to \u00a3242 and an Act of Parliament was passed in 1936, formally closing the canal, though there had been no boat traffic since 1929. The closure act stipulated that water levels should be maintained at 2 feet (60 cm) to support agricultural needs. This effectively guaranteed the continued existence of the canal channel, but structures such as locks and bridges deteriorated, and in the 1950s 46 of the 69 bridges over the canal were lowered as part of road improvement schemes. Although the low bridges act as barriers to navigation, large parts of the canal are still in water.In 1948 Britain's railways, and hence the canal, were nationalised, and became the responsibility of the British Transport Commission. In 1963 control of the canal passed to British Waterways. Under the terms of the Transport Act 1968, all waterways within the jurisdiction of British Waterways were classified as commercial, cruising or remainder waterways. Remainder waterways were those that were deemed to have no economic future, and maintenance would only be carried out where failure to do so would create health or safety issues. The Grantham Canal was listed in this latter category.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\n\nA plan to fill in a section of the canal in Nottingham resulted in a number of letters appearing in the local press in 1963, and a student at Kesteven College produced a report on the state of the canal, which was presented to the Grantham Civic Society. In 1970, the British Waterways Board attempted to obtain an act of parliament which would have allowed them to cease maintaining the water levels of the canal. The Inland Waterways Association campaigned against the bill, and the clause was amended. The Grantham Canal Society was formed soon afterwards, to promote restoration of the waterway. In 1974, a National Boat Rally was held at Nottingham, to gain support for the restoration scheme, and to promote the idea of a new link to the Trent, which would pass through old gravel workings.Together with British Waterways, the Inland Waterways Association and the Waterway Recovery Group, the Society began the work of restoration of the canal to navigation, a process which is still ongoing. A major development was the granting of permission in 1992 to remove an old railway embankment, which blocked the route near the top of the Woolsthorpe flight of locks. The task was completed by a number of Waterway Recovery Group workcamps. New gates were fitted to the top three locks, and rebuilding of Casthorpe bridge was funded by Lincolnshire County Council, opening up 4.4 miles (7.1 km) of the canal for navigation. Further down the canal, restoration of a 2.3-mile (3.7 km) section between Hickling Basin and Hose was funded by a derelict land grant of \u00a3400,000, received in 1993. The Grantham Canal Partnership was formed in 1997, as a way to take the project forwards. It consisted of representatives from each of the six local authorities through which the route passes, British Waterways, the Inland Waterways Association, the Grantham Canal Restoration Society and the Grantham Navigation Association, a group which had split off from the Canal Society in 1992. As a result of the co-operation, British Waterways formulated a draft business plan for the canal.Following the restoration of the top three locks at Woolsthorpe in the 1990s, a 10-mile (16-km) section from the A1 to Redmile will be completed once the bottom four locks of the flight are restored. The rebuilding of locks 6 and 7, completed in 2000, brought the number of locks restored to five, and approximately one quarter of the canal has been restored to navigable standard. Much improvement of the towpath has also taken place, and access to it is possible at most of the bridges.A major setback occurred in 2007, when one of the walls of Woolsthorpe top lock had to be propped to prevent it collapsing, and British Waterways took the decision to fill it in, as funding was not available to rebuild it. The Inland Waterways Association received a legacy of \u00a3100,000 from the estate of Fredrick Woodman, designated for the Grantham Canal, but British Waterways ruled that no work could start until the whole cost of \u00a3175,000 had been found. The balance was made up by grants of \u00a340,000 from Lincolnshire County Council and \u00a335,000 from the East Midlands Development Agency. The wall was demolished and rebuilt in three sections, utilizing 290 cubic yards (220 m3) of concrete and 7,500 new bricks.\n\nRestoration of most of the canal does not present major problems, but challenges are presented by the final sections at both ends. The original route to join the Trent has been severed by the building of the A52 road. A route was identified which followed the course of the Polser Brook, which passes under the A52 to the north of the canal, but by 2009, three possible solutions were under consideration. These pose additional problems in finding funding, since they do not count as restoration, and many of the traditional funding sources are not then available. At Grantham, an embankment carrying the A1 road blocks the line of the canal, and the terminal basin has been filled in. There are plans for a tunnel under the A1 as part of a cycle route to improve access to Grantham, and the basin could be redeveloped in due course.There is also a 5-mile (8 km) dry section between Cotgrave and Kinoulton, which has presented problems since construction in the 18th century: gypsum in the soil reacted with the waterproof clay leading to leaking.In early 2005, the Grantham Canal Partnership appointed a full-time Grantham Canal restoration manager, Kevin Mann, for an initial 18-month trial period. He would be responsible for planning and managing funding schemes for the restoration, identifying development opportunities and the promotion and interpretation of the canal. The trial proved to be successful, as he was still doing the job in 2009.The canal and its banks between Redmile and Harby is designated a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest as Grantham Canal SSSI.\n\n\n== Points of interest ==\n\n\n== Belvoir tramway ==\n\nThe Duke of Rutland also constructed a private wagonway or tramway between the wharf at Muston Gorse and Belvoir Castle. It was constructed in 1814\u201315, and remained operational for 100 years. It was constructed with fish-belly rail set into stone chairs, some of which, and some wagons, still exist in the castle cellars. The gauge was 4 ft 4+1\u20442 in (1,333 mm), and the rails were supplied by The Butterley Company. Some are in the collection of the science museum, and the National Railway Museum where there is the chassis of one of the wagons.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCanals of the United Kingdom\nHistory of the British canal system\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGrantham Canal Website\nNews story about repair of Woolsthorpe Locks, 2013-03-11\nimages & map of mile markers seen along the Grantham canal"

McCrory then moved to University College London to work with Uta Frith and Cathy J. Price obtaining his Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience in 2002. Subsequently, he undertook clinical training at King\u2019s College London, obtaining his Doctorate in Clinical Psychology in 2004.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter completing his Ph.D McCrory trained as a Clinical Psychologist and began therapeutic work within the NHS and NSPCC, focusing on children and adolescents with complex presentations who had experienced significant trauma. He joined University College London as a lecturer in 2006, where he established the MRes in Developmental Neuroscience and Psychopathology, in collaboration with Linda Mayes at the Child Study Centre, Yale University. He also created the Developmental Risk and Resilience Unit, a collaborative research team focusing on developmental disorders, with Essi Viding in 2008. He became professor of Developmental Neuroscience and Psychopathology at University College London in 2014.In 2018 McCrory co-founded the UK Trauma Council, an initiative that brings together expertise from across all four nations to improve outcomes for children and young people.  In 2019, he was appointed to the Executive leadership team at the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, a leading UK charity for child mental health.In 2020 McCrory became Director of the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) programme in Adolescent Mental Health and Wellbeing. In this capacity he is responsible for investing \u00a335 million in research and wider initiatives to improve the lives of young people in the U.K. McCrory also serves on a number of advisory committees, including the Scientific Advisory Board of NSPCC and the Early Intervention Foundation.

He is interested in why mental health problems develop, and has investigated how childhood trauma can impact brain structure and function in ways that may lead to an increased risk of later psychiatric disorder.He has argued that alterations in brain structure and function, associated with childhood maltreatment, may in part represent adaptation to early dangerous or unpredictable environments.\nIn his theory of Latent Vulnerability, developed with Essi Viding, he argues that while neurocognitive adaptations may confer benefits for the child in early adverse environments they can create increased vulnerability in the longer term, as the child becomes less well equipped to successfully negotiate more normative environments and developmental challenges. His research has documented altered functioning in an array of neurocognitive systems, including the threat, reward and autobiographical memory systems. McCrory\u2019s call for a greater focus on preventative approaches to child mental health has in part been informed by his finding that altered brain functioning following trauma is observable even before mental health problems emerge.He has recently argued for the importance of viewing the brain as a social organ, claiming that mental health vulnerability following childhood maltreatment can in part be understood as a socially mediated process.\n\n\n== Selected articles ==\nMcCrory, E.

It was a spin-off from DNAgents, which was also written by Evanier, set in the Image Universe.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe series featured the adventures of a Los Angeles bail bondsman named Jay Endicott; Endicott assumed the identity of the original Crossfire, a notorious criminal, who was murdered in the midst of one of his crimes. Endicott decided to use the costume to fight crime as a superhero while impersonating the original to take advantage of his reputation to secure, and then hunt down, underworld contacts.\nThe original Crossfire, Jeff Baker, first appeared in DNAgents #4. Jay Endicott first appeared in DNAgents #9.\nIn an early adventure, Endicott met the DNAgents and fell in love with their member, Rainbow. He was also seriously wounded and while in the care of the Agents' organization, he was given specific enhancements to his body such as replacing his blood with an artificial chemical that mimics the characteristics of blood more efficiently.\nIn addition to the superhero adventures, Evanier used his considerable experience in the Hollywood entertainment industry to feature secondary stories of characters trying to work and survive in that business. Evanier also contributed lengthy essays on the subject in each issue with illustrations by Sergio Aragones, a tradition continued in the later series, Hollywood Superstars for Epic Comics.\nThe character Jay Endicott was also the lead in a short-lived spin-off from Eclipse Comics, \"

"Coral_reefs_of_Kiribati| Coral reefs| Geography of Kiribati| ","The Coral reefs of Kiribati consists of 32 atolls  and one raised coral island, Banaba (Ocean Island), which is an isolated island between Nauru and the Gilbert Islands. The islands of Kiribati are dispersed over 3.5 million km2 (1.4 million sq mi) of the Pacific Ocean and straddle the equator and the 180th meridian, extending into the eastern and western hemispheres, as well as the northern and southern hemispheres. 21 of the 33 islands are inhabited. The groups of islands of Kiribati are:\n\nGilbert Islands: 16 atolls located some 1,500 kilometres (932 mi) north of Fiji.\nPhoenix Islands: 8 atolls and coral islands located some 1,800 kilometres (1,118 mi) southeast of the Gilberts.\nLine Islands: 8 atolls and one reef, located about 3,300 kilometres (2,051 mi) east of the Gilberts.The recognizable reef systems  in these archipelagos are: 3 reef communities or submerged reefs; 15 fringing reefs; and 18 atolls. In the Line Islands archipelago, Kingman Reef, Jarvis Island and Palmyra Atoll  are U.S. territories that are administered as part of the United States Minor Outlying Islands, although they are geographically part of the Line Islands archipelago. Kingman Reef, Jarvis Island and Palmyra Atoll are part of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument.The reefs in the Gilbert Islands are exposed to the effects of pollution and over-utilisation of the reef resources by the residents of the islands, which is similar to the threats to the Coral reefs of Tuvalu, which are to the south east of the Gilbert Islands. In contrast, most of atolls of the Phoenix Islands and Line Islands are uninhabited.The isolation of the Phoenix Islands, most of which are uninhabited, means they are among the most pristice coral reefs on Earth.\n\n\n== Areas of high biodiversity and conservation value ==\n\n\n=== Key Biodiversity Areas ===\n\nA total of 22 Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) - areas of high biodiversity and conservation value - have been identified in Kiribati, with the KBAs encompassing both marine and terrestrial systems (such as bird nesting or feeding environments).  The 22 identified KBAs cover an approximate total area of 4 thousand km2 (1.5 thousand sq mi) or approximately 74% of the total land, lagoon and reef habitat of Kiribati. As of 2013, 12 of the 22 KBAs have been completely or partially established as conservation areas by the government of Kiribati or by local village communities.The North Tarawa Conservation Area includes marine zones.Four marine reserves were specifically set aside for the conservation of grouper. These are all located in the Gilbert Islands on the atolls of Butaritari, Tabiteuea, Nonouti, and Onotoa and are managed by the Fisheries Division.\n\n\n=== Phoenix Islands Protected Area ===\nThe 2006 declaration of the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA), with a size of 408,250 km2 (157,630 sq mi), created, at that time, the world's largest designated marine protected area (MPA), which was also designated as the world's largest and deepest UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010. The U.S. administered Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument is currently the world's largest designated MPA, and is to the north and north-east of the PIPA.\nThe PIPA constitutes 11.34% of Kiribati's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The PIPA conserves one of the world's largest intact oceanic coral archipelago ecosystems, includes 14 known underwater seamounts (presumed to be extinct volcanoes) and other deep-sea habitats. The area contains approximately 800 known species of fauna, including about 200 coral species, 500 fish species, 18 marine mammals and 44 bird species. In total it is equivalent to the size of the state of California in the U.S., though the total land area is only 25 km2 (9.7 sq mi).There are three atolls with associated lagoons and perimeter coral reefs in the PIPA, Orona (Hull), Nikumaroro (Gardner), and Canton Island (Abariringa), and five low islands surrounded by fringing reefs, Manra (Sydney), Rawaki (Phoenix), McKean, Birnie and Enderbury, and also two submerged reefs, Winslow and Carondelet. The area contains seven main habitats: island, lagoon, coral reef, deep reef, seamount, deep benthos, and open ocean, which are all represented within PIPA and the Kanton Island protection zone.In the PIPA Management Plan 2015\u20132020, which was implemented following a Kiribati government decision in January 2014, there is a total ban on commercial fishing within the PIPA boundaries extending to the limits of the Territorial Sea (to 12 nm) and in all lagoons of the 8 PIPA islands, (Canton, Manra, Rawaki, Birnie, Mckean, Enderbury, Nikumaroro and Orona) to ensure there is no impact to marine and terrestrial species including habitats.Two submerged reefs, Winslow and Carondelet, and at least 14 known seamounts together with open ocean and deep-sea habitat are an integral part of the Phoenix Islands Protected Area. The New England Aquarium (NEAq) and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution have carried out scientific research expeditions of these seamount habitats, which have been identified being rich in deep-water coral and biodiversity supporting a variety of oceanic pelagic species. PIPA has been identified as an important feeding and spawning site for species of tuna. The dominant taxonomic group across all depths were the octocorals, followed by antipatharians, scleractinians, and then zoantharians.As of 2015, Canton Island had a population of 20, down from 61 in 2000. Because it is inhabited, management of Canton Island is described in the Canton Resource Use Sustainability Plan (KRUSP), which covers a 12 nm radius around the atoll. Over 50% of the island and lagoon are protected in a conservation zone.\n\n\n== Structure of the reefs of Kiribati ==\n\nThe coral atolls and reef islands of Kiribati have been formed from oceanic volcanos, with a coral reef growing around the shore of the volcano and then, over several million years, the volcano becomes extinct, eroded and subsided completely beneath the surface of the ocean. The reef and the small coral islets on top of it are all that is left of the original island, and a lagoon has taken the place of the former volcano.\nFor the atoll to persist, the coral reef must be maintained at the sea surface, with coral growth matching any relative change in sea level (subsidence of the island or rising oceans).  On the atolls, an annular reef rim surrounds the lagoon, and may include natural reef channels.Banaba is an elevated limestone cap surrounded by a fringing reef. The low islands of Makin, Tamana, Arorae, Enderbury, Flint and Vostok Island all lack lagoons but have a fringing reef.\n\n\n== State of the reefs of Kiribati ==\n\n\n=== Gilbert Islands ===\n\nThe reef environment of Kiribati includes approximately 200 species of corals and about 1,000 species of shellfish. The species of shellfish include the black-lipped pearl oyster (Pinctada margaritifera) and Anadara cockles (Anadara uropigimelana), and also the strombid gastropod (Strombus luhuanus).In the Central Gilbert Islands atolls of Abaiang, Abemama and Maiana, 3 species of giant clam (Tridacna) occur: Tridacna squamosa; Tridacna maxima; and Hippopus hippopus), although the stocks of the giant clam have been largely exhausted.Blue coral (Heliopora coerulea) is abundant on the reefs of the Gilbert Islands, such as on Tarawa although it is rarer on the windward reefs, in contrast to the more protected seaward reefs. Blue coral is absent from the Phoenix Islands  and the Line Islands. On the reefs of Tarawa the dominant species are Acropora muricata and Acropora hyacinthus, with extensive patches of Corallimorpharia and Porites rus along the southern seaward reef slope, large colonies of Plerogyra sinuosa are also present. The coral reef environment of Abaiang in the Northern Gilbert Islands includes: the occasional stand of Acropora (staghorn and table corals) and massive Porites rus; and on the western seaward reef of Abaiang are blue coral (Heliopora coerulea) and colonies of Porites cylindrica; with mixed species of Halimeda sp. (green macroalgae).\n\n\n=== Phoenix Islands ===\n\nThe 2000 surveys (Obura, et al.) identify that, at the time of these surveys, the reefs were in an excellent state of health, and free from the bleaching that has plagued reefs in other parts of the Pacific with no evidence of any coral diseases.The coral reefs of the Phoenix Islands were notable for their moderate Live Coral Cover (LCC) of 20-40% and evidence of high physical breakage of coral by wave energy on the southern, eastern and northern reefs of the islands (the windward sides), which create coral rubble in the lagoons and base of the reefs.  The dominant bottom cover of the lagoons was hard coral (36.0%), followed by coralline algae (red algae) (18.0%), coral rubble (16.7%), turf and fleshy algae (11.6%) and Halimeda (green macroalgae) (10.4%). The dominance of coral and coralline algae indicates healthy reef ecosystems dominated by calcifying organisms and active reef framework growth.The effect of exposure to storms is indicated by the dominance trends with storm resistant encrusting/submassive forms in windward sites, its somewhat lower abundance at leeward sites and a corresponding increase in more delicate plate forms, and the dominance of  the more fragile table and staghorn corals in protected lagoon sites.  Coral species diversity is higher on the larger islands of Nikumaroro, Kanton and Orona, which indicates the importance of the larger area of reef on these islands for support of biodiversity. Carpeting soft corals (Sinularia and Lobophytum) were found at the bottom of the lagoons of Kanton and Orona, which are the only true lagoons in the Phoenix Islands.Crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci), cushion star and other coral predators, such as the corallivorous snail Drupella spp., are found on the reefs of the Phoenix Islands, although there has not been any indication of destructive outbreaks of those predators on the reefs.Species of giant clam (Tridacna) occur in low numbers: Tridacna squamosa, Tridacna maxima, but not Tridacna gigas.The 2000 surveys identified the following coral species as being the most abundant coral species at the specific sites on each atoll that was surveyed:\n\n\n=== Line Islands ===\n\nKiritimati (Christmas Island) in the Line Islands has the greatest land area of any  coral atoll in the world, at about 388 square kilometres (150 square miles). The atoll is about 150 km (93 mi) in perimeter, while the lagoon shoreline extends for over 48 km (30 mi). The entire island is a Wildlife Sanctuary.Surveys of the Northern Line Islands in 2007 identified a shifted from domination by reef-building stony corals and coralline algae (red algae) at Kingman Reef and Palmyra Atoll (both are  U.S. territory), to domination by macroalgae (including species of Halimeda (green macroalgae), Caulerpa, Avrainvillea, Dictyosphaeria and Lobophora) and algal turfs at Tabuaeran and especially Kiritimati (both are part of Kiribati). Coral density tracked coral cover and was highest at Kingman Reef and lowest at Kiritimati.Stony corals plus coralline algae strongly dominated the reefs at Kingman Reef (71% LCC) with numerous large coral colonies (primarily table and branching Acropora spp.). Cover of stony corals plus coralline algae dropped to 48% LCC at Palmyra, 38% LCC at Tabuaeran, and 21% LCC at Kiritimati. The types of coral were much more variable at Tabuaeran than the other atolls. Some sites on the reefs at Tabuaeran were dominated by coralline algae and Acropora corals (maximum 63% combined cover), whereas other sites were dominated by fleshy algae (79% combined cover of turf and macro-algae). However, turf algae were the most common group overall (36% cover), whereas dead corals carpeted by turf and macroalgae more uniformly dominated the reefs at Kiritimati (68% mean combined cover). The numbers of juvenile colonies 1 cm (0.39 in) to 5 cm (2.0 in)  of Acropora, Pocillopora and Fungiidae corals, were more than 6 times higher at Kingman Reef and Palmyra than at Tabuaeran and Kiritimati.Giant clams (Tridacna) were also more abundant at Kingman Reef than elsewhere in the Line Islands. Clams are harvested for consumption at Kiritimati.Some coral species that remain at risk in Kiribati due to the gaps in the protection of Key Biodiversity Areas include: Acropora echinata (procumbens), Acropora vaughani, Alveopora verrilliana, and Montipora patula, all recorded only on Tabuaeran in the Line Islands.\n\n\n== Bleaching ==\n\nThere has been bleaching of the (Acropora spp.) staghorn branching corals and other corals on the reefs of Kiribati. Bleaching is a process that expels the photosynthetic algae from the corals' \"

The school is composed of two campuses, one each in Middletown, Virginia, United States and Warrenton, Virginia, United States. Admission is determined via an application process.\n\n\n== History ==\nPlanning for Mountain Vista began in 2003; its participating counties were one of the last in the state not covered by an existing academic-year governor's school or similar program.  The participating school systems surveyed parents and students within their respective counties to gauge interest. A plan for implementation was created and put into motion;  A committee was formed, and approval was sought from the Virginia Department of Education.  A first review of the plan was presented to the Virginia Department of Education at their January 11, 2006 meeting.  \nThe funding for MVGS (a total of $190,544) was first approved in the 2006-2008 Biennial Budget passed by the Virginia House of Delegates.On January 11, the estimated portion of the school budget that the participating counties had to pay was approximately $216,527; it was divided among each of the counties.   Each county's school board was responsible for approving both the funding and a 3-year commitment in order for the project to continue. Each jurisdiction was made responsible for the funding for each slot at the governor's school allocated to them.\nIn May 2006, Dr. Rosanne Williamson was named director of Mountain Vista, and she assumed the post on July 1.On January 15, 2011,  students from both campuses travelled with their teachers to Richmond, where they participated in the 2011 Volvo Construction Challenge. The Middletown team of four students placed second in the Transportation Infrastructure challenge.\n\n\n== Admission ==\nEach participating county has a local committee that decides who attends from that county.  Students interested must complete an application and submit transcripts and two written essays.  The applications along with teacher recommendations are reviewed by the local committee and admission decisions are made.\n\n\n=== Participating localities ===\nThe number of slots at the governor's school allocated to each jurisdiction, as of September 14, 2006:\n\nFrederick & Fauquier (30)\nCulpeper (15)\nWinchester (13)\nWarren (15)\nRappahannock (4)\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe Mountain Vista Governor's School program does not have a classroom facility of its own.  Instead, students travel to Lord Fairfax Community College to take courses offered by the program, then the students return to their home schools and maintain eligibility for sports and extracurricular activities there. The area served by Mountain Vista is too large for a single location to which busing all students would be practical; LFCC was chosen because it has a campus on each end of the area covered by Mountain Vista. The two sites are connected via videoconferencing that allow them to interact with each other.In addition, all Mountain Vista students are given laptops by their respective county for use year round. During the 06-07 and 07-08 school years, the school used the Blackboard Academic Suite of e-Education software designed to allow the students to submit and retrieve notes and assignments on snow days or other missed days of school, and to provide virtual office hours for instructors. Frederick County Public Schools provided the means of sharing their purchased BAS with MVGS. However, during the 2008-09 school year, Frederick County switched to the ANGEL Learning Management System, causing Mountain Vista to change to ANGEL along with it. MVGS also used a private discussion board for communication between staff and students. Then, in the 2011-2012 school year, MVGS decided to change from ANGEL to Google sites due to technical issues with ANGEL. Google groups were created as classes and Google mail sent out homework quickly and efficiently.\n\n\n== Academics ==\nThe Mountain Vista curriculum was designed to be a college level mathematics and science program providing a solid basis for doing research and making connections between disciplines. The classes are connected in a way that when a topic is being taught in physics, a similar concept is being taught in math and humanities is discussing social applications and ramifications of the subject.  Most of the courses have homework assignments assigned during the summer and due on the first day of class making learning a year-round activity.   A number of MVGS classes are Dual Enrollment, AP, or both, giving the students the ability to earn college credits while still in high school.\nThe courses offered are:\n\nScience:\nMVGS Physics I: Mechanics\nMVGS Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism\nMVGS Chemistry\nMathematics:\nMVGS Math Analysis (Pre-Calculus)\nMVGS First Year Calculus\nMVGS Second Year Calculus with Topics in Multivariable\nMVGS Statistics\nHumanities:\nMVGS Humanities I: The Power of Thought / English 11\nMVGS Humanities II: Applying the Power of Persuasion to World Issues /Government\nResearch:\nMVGS Research I:  Introduction to the Fundamentals of the Research Process\nMVGS Research II:  Exploration of Cutting-Edge Science and Technology Fields (Applied Research)Starting in the 2012-2013 school year, the follow courses will also be offered:\n\nBiology:\nMVGS Biology I: Introduction\nMVGS Biology II: Advanced Topics (Genetics, Ecology, and the Physiology of Organisms)Along with in class work, classes include projects that allow for hands on problem solving and collaboration with other students like a water balloon launch competition.\n\n\n== Graduates ==\nThe first class graduated in 2007. Almost half of the students reportedly attend reputable Virginia schools, such as the University of Virginia, College of William and Mary, Virginia Commonwealth University, and Virginia Tech, some becoming Echols scholars. Alumni have also attended Ivy League and U.S. military colleges. In the class of 2011, some alumni attended Yale University, Johns Hopkins University, Washington University in St. Louis, Vanderbilt University, University of California, Berkeley, Tufts University, and Purdue University.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGovernor's Schools (Virginia)\nMagnet School\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMountain Vista Governor's School for Science, Math and Technology"

He received compensation, and used it to fund a university course in Dramatic Writing. Some years later, he developed a two-hander play about a convicted terrorist being interviewed in prison by a psychiatrist. It premi\u00e8red at the Brighton Festival Fringe in May 2009, and received the Best Theatrical Performance Award. It was later adapted for radio.\nIn 2011, comparisons were drawn between the terror campaign, the play, and the attacks in Norway.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe First Domino play takes its name from the domino effect, and was written as a response to a real-world nail bomb attack.In 1999, David Copeland, a Neo-Nazi and former member of the British National Party, who was found to have decorated his bedroom with Nazi symbols and collected news stories on racist attacks, intended to stir up ethnic and homophobic tension with a series of bombs targeting the minority communities of London. The first attack was in the largely black community of Brixton on Saturday, 17 April 1999. The second hit the Asian community of Brick Lane on Saturday, 24 April 1999. The third took place at a pub in Old Compton Street, Soho \u2013 the heart of London's gay community.On Friday 30 April 1999, a sunny evening after work, Jonathan Cash \u2013 author of the play \u2013 had agreed to meet two friends in the Admiral Duncan, as was usual for them. While he waited, patrons noticed an unattended bag. The previous two bombs had made Londoners wary; although they had been described as race-hate attacks, police had issued a warning that a gay bar could be the bomber's next target, and The Yard \u2013  another pub in the area \u2013  had displayed a poster warning customers to be alert.\nThe Admiral Duncan bomb, a home made device of fertiliser and nails, exploded at 6:37 p.m.\nIt was the loudest, most alien noise I have ever heard. It ripped through the building. I really can't say how long it lasted; a few seconds perhaps. I can't remember, but there was a crunch of something solid, something structural. But what I can remember is the acrid smell, the sulphurous dust. My ears were ringing, my eyes were smarting, the dust filled my nose making it hard to breathe. \n\nThree people died as a result of the blast (including a pregnant woman) and many more were seriously hurt, including Cash, who was standing close to the bomb; he received injuries to his back and shoulder, and burns to his face and legs.David Copeland was convicted of murder on 30 June 2000, and given six concurrent life sentences. He had been diagnosed by five psychiatrists as having paranoid schizophrenia. In 2007, the High Court ruled that he must serve at least 50 years.Cash received financial compensation, and used it to fund an MA in Dramatic Writing at the University of Sussex, saying he \"

The state of emergency authorized the military to enforce security nationwide. It imposed restrictions on freedom of speech and access to information. The duration was initially announced for six months. The Constitution of Ethiopia provides for a six-month state of emergency under certain conditions. The declaration of the state of emergency followed massive protests by the Oromo and Amhara ethnic groups against the government, which was dominated by the Tigray People's Liberation Front, largely consisting of Tigrayans, a smaller ethnic group. The 2016 state of emergency was the first in about 25 years in Ethiopia.

First described from New York in 1898, the fungus is found in eastern Asia, Central America, and eastern North America from Canada to Florida. It is a mycorrhizal species and typically grows in association with oak and beech trees.\nThe fruit bodies (mushrooms) formed by the fungus have convex to nearly flat caps that are up to 13 cm (5.1 in) wide. The stems are up to 10 cm (3.9 in) long by 3 cm (1.2 in) thick, and feature reticulations (net-like ridges) on the upper portion. Other than the brownish upper cap, the entire surface of the mushroom is yellow. B. auripes is edible. It can be distinguished from other similar yellow boletes by differences in color, degree of stem reticulation, and distribution.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe species was originally described by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1898. Peck collected the type specimen in Port Jefferson, New York. In 1945, Rolf Singer proposed the variety Boletus auripes var. aureissimus as a new combination of the name Ceriomyces aureissimus described by William Alphonso Murrill in 1938; this taxon is now regarded as a distinct species under the name Boletus aureissimus. In 1936, Wally Snell reported finding a specimen of Boletus crassipes, another species described by Peck from Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania. Snell suggested that although B. crassipes might be a valid species distinguished from B. auripes by a deeper brown cap color, yellow flesh that does not fade to white, and a stem with a more orange-yellow color and more extensive reticulation, he conceded that it was not clear that the morphological characteristics between the two did not overlap, and that further collections would be needed to clarify any differences between them. A couple of years later, he was more convinced of his stance and considered the two conspecific. The taxonomic authorities Index Fungorum and MycoBank, however, do not recognize this putative synonymy.In the genus Boletus, B. auripes is classified in section Appendiculati. Species in this section are characterized by having a dry cap with a surface texture ranging from smooth to somewhat tomentose, yellow flesh, a reticulate stem, and a mild taste. Other North American boletes in this section include Boletus speciosus and Boletus regius.The specific epithet auripes means \"

Rosario was the father of the future California mob boss, Frank DeSimone. He is not to be confused with the Chicago Italian Timothy Rosario DeSimone.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDeSimone was born in Salaparuta, Sicily, Italy, on 11 December 1873. He initially settled in New Orleans before moving to Pueblo, Colorado. In Pueblo he was part of that city's Mafia organization, and was evidently well-respected. He became a close ally of Vito Di Giorgio in Los Angeles. Upon Di Giorgio's death in Chicago in 1922, DeSimone took power. His empire spanned over Los Angeles County. His rule in Los Angeles was brief, and he stepped down around 1925. He later became a legitimate businessman who settled in Downey, California. DeSimone died of natural causes in 1946.\n\n\n=== Family ===\nDeSimone married twice and fathered several children. Frank DeSimone, his second son, became a criminal attorney and later don of the crime family, reigning from 1956 to 1967.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nGentile, Nick, with Felice Chilanti.

"Heinzenhausen| Municipalities in Rhineland-Palatinate| Kusel (district)| ","Heinzenhausen on the Lauter is an Ortsgemeinde \u2013 a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality \u2013 in the Kusel district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Lauterecken-Wolfstein.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe municipality lies in the North Palatine Uplands in the Lauter valley at an elevation of roughly 175 m above sea level, about halfway between the towns of Lauterecken and Wolfstein. The elevations either side of the dale reach up to 350 m above sea level (Schauerberg 328 m, Jungenwald 349 m). The municipal area measures 221 ha, of which roughly 15 ha is settled and 93 ha is wooded.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nHeinzenhausen borders in the east on the municipality of Hohen\u00f6llen, in the south on the town of Wolfstein and in the west and north on the municipality of Lohnweiler. Heinzenhausen also meets the municipality of Oberweiler-Tiefenbach at a single point in the southeast.\n\n\n=== Municipality\u2019s layout ===\nThe village of Heinzenhausen stretches along the dale, for the most part on the Lauter's right bank and is concentrated towards the north where a small brook empties into the river at the village core. Here, Bundesstra\u00dfe 270 crosses the Lauter. The Lauter Valley Railway runs along the brook's left bank with a stop in the village's south end. The graveyard lies east of the village core.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nIt is certain that the area around the village was settled in prehistoric times, and this is witnessed by comprehensive prehistoric archaeological finds, particularly from the municipal area of the neighbouring municipality of Lohnweiler. In Heinzenhausen itself, a stone hatchet made of volcanic material was found east of the village. Formerly, two barrows were also known, but today they can no longer be found. Roman finds are also known from neighbouring municipalities.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nIt was likely in the Early Middle Ages that today's village of Heinzenhausen was founded, although it is impossible to pinpoint the founding date. The village lay in the Nahegau and then later passed to the County of Veldenz when this was founded in the earlier half of the 12th century. In 1282, King Rudolph I of Germany gave Count Heinrich III of Hohenecken and his wife Margarethe leave to sell the estate of Mittelrohrbach, a royal fief, with all its appurtenances and serfs to Otterberg Abbey. Against this sale, the king accepted from the comital couple the Lampertsm\u00fchle (a mill) and a meadow in Heinzemanneshusen sub Castro Wolvestein, that is to say, beneath the castle of Wolfstein. Besides the documents from the year of first documentary mention, the village's name appears in further documents from the earlier line of the Counts of Veldenz (1259-1444). Among them is a 1379 document according to which Count Friedrich II of Veldenz enfeoffed Johann Mohr von S\u00f6tern with holdings in Heinzenhausen. A year later, Gerhard von Alsenz acknowledged the receipt of interest from, among other villages, Heinzenhausen. In 1422, Count Friedrich III of Veldenz enfeoffed the brothers Johann and Philipp Boos von Waldeck with a series of villages, along with the estate of Wusthausen and his own holdings in Heinzenhausen. The Barons von Boos zu Waldeck owned an estate in Heinzenhausen until the end of feudal times when the German lands on the Rhine\u2019s left bank were occupied by French Revolutionary troops.  Count Friedrich III was the last from the Hohengeroldseck family to rule Veldenz - that male line died out with him in 1444, and the county passed to his son-in-law Stephen, Count Palatine of Simmern-Zweibr\u00fccken, a son of Rupert, King of Germany and widower of Frederick's daughter, Anna of Veldenz. Stephen, combining his lands, created the new County Palatine of Zweibr\u00fccken, which in the fullness of time came to be known as the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibr\u00fccken. Stephen chose the town of Zweibr\u00fccken as comital residence. Heinzenhausen now belonged to this new County Palatine.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\nIn 1532, when a young Wolfgang, Count Palatine of Zweibr\u00fccken inherited his holdings, his uncle Rupert served as the child's regent. In 1543, when Wolfgang reached majority and took on the responsibility of office, he enacted the Marburg Contract, giving Rupert the County of Veldenz, including Heinzenhausen with it.\nLike almost all villages in the Glan region, Heinzenhausen, too, suffered under the ravages of the 17th century's wars, both the Thirty Years' War and French King Louis XIV's wars of conquest. However, during the Thirty Years' War, the nearby residence town of Lauterecken afforded the villagers shelter, and it was never overrun by the French. Nevertheless, death reaped a rich harvest even here with hunger and the Plague. The County met its end in 1694, when Leopold Louis, Count Palatine of Veldenz died with no heir. Now came a dispute over whether the county \u2013 and thereby Heinzenhausen with it \u2013 should pass to the Electorate of the Palatinate or be returned to the County Palatine of Zweibr\u00fccken, which at that time was ruled by Swedish King Charles XI. Charles took ownership of the \u00c4mter of Veldenz and Lauterecken along with the Remigiusberg, but in 1697, the Electorate of the Palatinate dispatched troops, and quickly took the Amt of Lauterecken. A permanent solution to the dispute came only in 1733, in Palatinate's favour, with the so-called Treaty of Succession. Johann Goswin Widder, in his 1788 work Geographische Beschreibung der Kurpfalz (\u201cGeographical Description of Electoral Palatinate\u201d), wrote about Heinzenhausen, among other things: \u201cHeinzenhausen, a slight little village of 15 houses on the Lauter\u2019s right bank, lying half an hour up from Lauterecke, was called long ago Heinzemanneshusen \u2026 Nevertheless, the village seems to have been subject, with the Vogtei, at all times to the Counts of Veldenz and Castle Lauterecke.\u201d\n\n\n==== Recent times ====\nDuring the time of the French Revolution and Napoleonic times, the German lands on the Rhine\u2019s left bank were annexed by France. Along the Glan ran the boundary between the Departments of Mont-Tonnerre (or Donnersberg in German) and Sarre. Heinzenhausen now lay in the Department of Mont-Tonnerre/Donnersberg, the Arrondissement of Kaiserslautern, the Canton of Lauterecken and the Mairie (\u201cMayoralty\u201d) of Lauterecken. In 1814, the French were driven out of the German lands on the Rhine's left bank, and after a brief transitional period, there was a new territorial arrangement, under which Heinzenhausen now lay in the bayerischer Rheinkreis (\u201cBavarian Rhine District\u201d), later called the bayerische Rheinpfalz (\u201cBavarian Rhenish Palatinate\u201d), but by any name, it was the territory on the Rhine that the Congress of Vienna had awarded to the Kingdom of Bavaria. Within this, Heinzenhausen lay in the Landkommissariat (later Bezirksamt, and later still Landkreis, or district) of Kusel, the Canton (later Distrikt until sometime about the First World War) of Lauterecken and the B\u00fcrgermeisterei (\u201cMayoralty\u201d) of Lauterecken. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Nazi Party (NSDAP) was quite popular in Heinzenhausen. In the 1928 Reichstag elections, 29.1% of the local votes went to Adolf Hitler\u2019s party, but by the 1930 Reichstag elections, this had grown to 40.2%. By the time of the 1933 Reichstag elections, after Hitler had already seized power, local support for the Nazis had swollen to 83.3%. Hitler\u2019s success in these elections paved the way for his Enabling Act of 1933 (Erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz), thus starting the Third Reich in earnest. After the Second World War, the Bavarian exclave on the Rhine\u2019s left bank was grouped into the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Heinzenhausen now lay in the Regierungsbezirk of Pfalz (\u201cPalatinate\u201d) within this state, and then later, after the Regierungsbezirke were reorganized, in the Regierungsbezirk of Rheinhessen-Pfalz. Regierungsbezirke have since been abolished in Rhineland-Palatinate and are therefore no longer a feature of the administrative structure. In the course of the 1968 administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, Heinzenhausen was grouped as a self-administering Ortsgemeinde into the Verbandsgemeinde of Lauterecken with effect from 1 January 1972.\n\n\n=== Population development ===\nThe village has remained rurally structured. Even today, the surrounding countryside is used for agriculture, though the number of farmers has shrunk. Thus, Heinzenhausen has become a small residential community with job opportunities in the area's major centres (Lauterecken, Wolfstein, Kaiserslautern).\nThe following table shows population development over the centuries for Heinzenhausen:\n\n\n=== Municipality\u2019s name ===\nThe village's name underwent several changes through the ages:\n\n1279, 1282 \u2013 Heinzemanneshusen\n1377, 1379 \u2013 Heintzenhusen\n1380 \u2013 Heintzinhusen\n1387 \u2013 Heintzenhausen, Heintzenhui\u00dfen\n14th century \u2013 Heynzenhu\u00dfe\n1506 \u2013 Heynczenhusen\n1588 \u2013 Heintzenhausen\n1787, 1828, 1837 \u2013 HeinzenhausenThe pet form of the name Heimrich (later form: Heinrich) developed through Heino and Heini to Heinzemann (or, according to Dolch and Greule, perhaps through the form Heinz). The first name Heinzemann is a form that was particularly popular in the 13th and 14th centuries. Thus it may be possible to infer something about the roots of the name Heinzenhausen.\n\n\n=== Vanished villages ===\nWithin Heinzenhausen's limits once lay the village of W\u00fcsthausen, also called Wusthauserhof. It had its first documentary mention in 1422. The name still crops up in 18th-century documents.\n\n\n== Religion ==\nIt is likely that Heinzenhausen originally belonged to the Church of Lohnweiler, and later the Church of Lauterecken. Wolfgang, Count Palatine of Zweibr\u00fccken, introduced the Reformation to Zweibr\u00fccken as early as 1537, and all the inhabitants had to convert to Lutheran teaching. Wolgang gave the Heinzenhausen area, as part of his gift of the County of Veldenz, to his uncle and former regent, the newly created Rupert, Count Palatine of Veldenz, in 1543. In 1648, at the end of the Thirty Years' War, it became possible to the subjects of Veldenz to convert to Calvinism, and indeed to Catholicism. Conversions to Catholicism and the coming of Catholic settlers became very common after 1733, after the village became an Electoral Palatinate holding. Of the 146 inhabitants in 1825, 76 were Evangelical and 70 were Catholic. In 1961, of the 336 inhabitants that were counted, 289 were Evangelical and only 45 were Catholic. This can be explained by the arrival of many Evangelical families during the 19th century. Jewish inhabitants do not show up in any available statistics at all.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Municipal council ===\nThe council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\nHeinzenhausen's mayor is Frank Kohl, and his deputies are Sonja Wolke and Henning Baldauf \n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe municipality's arms might be described thus: Per fess wavy sable a demilion Or armed, langued and crowned gules and argent a waterwheel spoked of four azure surmounted by a bridge arched of two issuant from base set slightly to sinister of the field (?) masoned of the first.\nThe charge in the upper half of the escutcheon is the Palatine lion, a reference to the village's former allegiance to the Palatinate, while those below the wavy line of partition represent the bridge across the river Lauter and the mill on that river. The arms have been borne since 1986 when they were approved by the now defunct Rheinhessen-Pfalz Regierungsbezirk administration in Neustadt an der Weinstra\u00dfe.\n\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n\n\n=== Regular events ===\nHeinzenhausen's kermis (church consecration festival) is held on the first weekend in August, and the Nachkirmes (\u201cAfter-Kermis\u201d) on the third weekend in September. Old customs such as were once observed in all villages in the Glan area are nowadays hardly practised at all.\n\n\n=== Clubs ===\nThe following clubs are to be found in Heinzenhausen:\nAngelsportverein \u201eUnteres Glantal\u201c \u2014 angling\nF\u00f6rderverein der Freiwilligen Feuerwehr \u2014 fire brigade promotional association\nHeenzehauser Wicke-Wacke \u2014 \u201cfun club\u201d\nLandfrauenverein \u2014 countrywomen's club\nM\u00e4nnergesangverein \u2014 men's singing club\nSPD-Ortsverein \u2014 Social Democratic Party of Germany local chapter\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Economic structure ===\nBesides agriculture, there were in earlier times the customary craft occupations in Heinzenhausen. At the Petersgrube colliery in the 19th century, 5 to 8 workers were employed, who between 1835 and 1855 mined 2 567 t of coal. The gristmill was up and running as early as the 18th century with both grinding and husking stones. It was shut down after the Second World War. Agricultural businesses are today quite rare. A prefabricated house firm in the village specializes in building timber-frame houses and energy-saving prefabricated houses. High-grade stainless steel furniture, mainly for the restaurant industry, is made by another firm. Other crafts of the traditional kinds are no longer customary. Also in the village are insurance agencies and a firm for distributing advertising articles.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nIt is highly likely that as early as the 16th century, there were efforts to teach children to read and write, since the Counts Palatine of Zweibr\u00fccken had introduced the Reformation and were especially interested in putting the country's children in a position to read the Bible. School was held in an ordinary house. Today, Hauptschule and Gymnasium students go to the corresponding schools in Lauterecken.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nHeinzenhausen lies on Bundesstra\u00dfe 270, which links Idar-Oberstein with Kaiserslautern. Branching off Bundesstra\u00dfe 270 is Landesstra\u00dfe 383, which leads to the neighbouring village of Hohen\u00f6llen. Lauterecken lies 5 km away, while Kaiserslautern lies 27 km away and Kusel 35 km away. Serving the municipality is a railway station on the Lauter Valley Railway (Lautertalbahn, Lauterecken-Kaiserslautern).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHeinzenhausen in the collective municipality\u2019s webpages (in German)"

"Araki_language| Espiritu Santo languages| Languages of Vanuatu| Endangered Austronesian languages| Endangered languages of Oceania| ","Araki is a nearly extinct language spoken in the small island of Araki (locally known as [\u02c8\u027eaki]), south of Espiritu Santo Island in Vanuatu. Araki is gradually being replaced by Tangoa, a language from a neighbouring island.\n\n\n== Current situation ==\nAraki was estimated to have 8 native speakers in 2012 with ongoing language shift towards the neighboring language Tangoa. The rest of the island's population have a passive knowledge of Araki, allowing them to understand it, but having limited ability to speak it. A large portion of the Araki vocabulary, as well as idiosyncratic syntactic and phonetic phenomena of the language have been lost. The pidgin Bislama is spoken by many speakers of Araki as a lingua franca, though its use is mainly in the two towns of the country, Port-Vila and Luganville, and seldom in rural areas.\nAraki was described in 2002 by the linguist Alexandre Fran\u00e7ois.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nAraki belongs to the Oceanic branch of Austronesian languages; more precisely, to the group \u2018North and Central Vanuatu languages\u2019.\n\n\n== Phonology ==\nAraki has a phonological inventory of 16 consonant phonemes and 5 vowels, which are shown in the following two tables:\n\n\n=== Consonants ===\nAraki has 16 consonants which generally appear at the beginning of a syllable, with some exceptions. \n\nOnly fluent speakers of Araki distinguish between the flap [\u027e] and the trill [r]; and only they can distinguish and pronounce the linguolabial consonants. 'Passive' users of the language replace these consonants either with bilabial consonants or alveolar consonants. Although many younger people claim to be able to speak Araki, they are usually passive speakers, and therefore do not use linguolabial consonants.\n\n\n=== Vowels ===\nThe vowel phonemes are:\n\nAraki does not possess phonemic long vowels. Also, the language does not have phonemic diphthongs. However, strings of consecutive vowels are possible - indeed prevalent - in the language. In these cases, each vowel builds a separate syllable.\n\n\n=== Syllable structure and stress ===\nMost syllables in Araki are open (CV). Diachronic effects of word stress have led to the irregular loss of some syllables, and the creation of new phonotactic patterns of CVC and CCV, with many word-final consonants. Although a cluster of more than two consonants is impossible within a word, longer consonant clusters may appear in longer linguistic sequences.\nWord stress in Araki normally falls on the penultimate syllable, at least when the last syllable of the word is of the form -(C)V. A secondary stress may be heard on every second syllable toward the left of the word. Stress is assigned only after the lexeme has received all its affixes to form the whole phonological word. A process of final high vowel deletion (which is common in Vanuatu languages) does not affect the stress rule.\n\n\n== Writing System ==\nAn older orthography used \u27e8c\u27e9 for t\u0361\u0283, \u27e8d\u27e9 for \u027e, \u27e8r\u27e9 for r, and \u27e8g\u27e9 for \u014b.\n\n\n== Grammar ==\nAraki syntax can be divided into an open set of lexemes, including nouns, adjectives, verbs, adjuncts, adverbs, numerals and demonstratives; and a closed set of morphemes, which are often monosyllabic clitics or affixes.\n\n\n=== Word order ===\nThe constituent order in Araki is strictly subject\u2013verb\u2013object (SVO). There is a clear formal boundary between the direct object - always internal to the predicate phrase, whether incorporated or not - and the oblique arguments: adverbs, prepositional phrases and indirect objects, which always appear outside the verb phrase.\n\n\n=== Nouns ===\nAs in many Oceanic languages, not only verbs but also nouns (as well as other syntactic categories) are predicative in Araki. Nouns differ from verbs in being directly predicative, which means that they do not have to be preceded by a subject clitic. Also, only nouns are able to refer directly to entities of the world, and make them arguments entering into larger sentence structures.\nSyntactically speaking, a noun can be either the subject of a sentence, the object of a transitive verb or the object of a preposition, all syntactic slots which are forbidden to verbs or adjectives. Proper names - place names and personal names - can be said to belong to the global category of nouns in Araki.\n\n\n==== Noun-phrase structure ====\nContrary to many languages of Vanuatu, Araki did not retain the noun article *na of Proto Oceanic, nor any other obligatory noun determiner. As a consequence, a noun root on its own can form a valid NP in a sentence.\nA Noun Phrase must have a head - this can be a noun, an independent pronoun or certain demonstratives. an adjective cannot be a NP-head, but needs the support of the empty head mada. All other elements are optional. A maximal NP should follow the following order of constituents, most of which are optional:\n\nan article: plural dai, partitive re, definite va;\na noun or the empty head mada, or a 'possessive bundle', formed by {possessed noun + (a possessive classifier +) a possessor};\nan adjective;\nthe anaphoric marker di\na demonstrative word\na numeral preceded by a subject clitic (usually mo), similar to a clause;\na relative clause;\na prepositional phrase.It is rare to meet more than three or four elements in one NP.\n\n\n==== Articles and reference-tracking devices ====\nSemantically speaking, a noun without an article can be specific as well as non-specific, and definite as well as indefinite. Moreover, not only is there no gender-distinction, but even number is most of the time under-specified; only the context, and partly the personal marker on the verb, help distinguish between singular and plural reference.\nSeveral devices are available - though always optional - in Araki to help track the reference of a particular NP. These are the clitics va, di, mada, dai, re, mo hese, which appear as shown in the above list.\nThe pro-clitic va and the post-clitic di both mark anaphoric relations. va is placed immediately before the noun, and codes for discourse-internal anaphora (that is, reference to a term that has already been introduced in the earlier context). di immediately follows the noun, and seems to refer to the immediate context preceding it (comparable with the English anaphoric use of 'this').\nThe construction {va N di} does not exist. This indicates that the two clitics must have different uses.\nThe empty head mada can be found at the beginnings of NPs. It never occurs alone, but is always followed by an adjective or a place name. Its role is to refer to a set of human individuals defined by the next word, in a similar way to English 'one' in the small one(s). mada can be described as a personal nominalizer. It does not involve definiteness or number.\nThe plural marker dai makes explicit the plurality of the NP, which is otherwise never coded for, and often left implicit. As all other markers mentioned in this section, it too is optional.\nThe specific indefinite mo hese, a numeral quantifier meaning 'one', is very commonly, if not obligatorily, used when a referent is introduced for the first time into the discourse. mo hese may be used as a numerical predicate, contrasting with other numbers, but it is most frequently used as a kind of article following the NP in order to mark it as being indefinite, that is, newly introduced into the discourse.\nThe partitive\u2013indefinite pro-clitic re is used when the NP refers to a new, non-specific instance of a notion. In order to understand this concept, compare the English sentences 'I ate a banana ' with 'I want to eat a banana '. Besides being indefinite in both cases, in the first sentence a banana is specific, because it refers to a specific banana; in the second sentence a banana is non-specific, because it can refer to any banana, not one in particular. Although this semantic difference is not grammaticalized in English, it is in Araki, using re as a marker for non-specific indefinite reference.\nThe function of the aforementioned reference-tracking devices can be summarized as follows: \n\n\n=== Verbs ===\nVerbs are predicative words, which are preceded by subject clitics. Unlike nouns, they cannot form a direct predicate (that is, without a clitic), and cannot refer to an entity, nor form the subject of a sentence. They cannot directly modify a noun by just following it. From the semantic point of view, verbs refer to actions, events or states. Each verb in Araki must be marked with either Realis or Irrealis mood.\nThe only obligatory elements of a verb phrase are the head and the subject clitic. This can be extended not only to phrases headed by a verb, but also to phrases headed by an adjective or a numeral. Under certain conditions, a noun can also be the head of a so-called 'VP', provided that it is endowed with mood-aspectual properties, such as negation.\nFrom a syntactic point of view, Araki contrasts intransitive with transitive verbs.\n\n\n==== Intransitive verbs ====\nIntransitive verbs never take either object NPs or transitive suffixes.\nThey are morphologically unvarying (that is, receive no morphological markings).\n\n\n==== Transitive verbs ====\nTransitive verbs take object arguments, as NPs and/or as object suffixes. Most transitive (or transitivised) verbs, though not all of them, can be morphologically marked as such. This usually implies the presence of a transitivity suffix -i and/or of an object personal suffix.\nSome verbs can be described as having oblique transitivity, since they are usually followed by an oblique (generally, prepositional) complement.\nAraki does not normally allow for ditransitive verbs. Where English would have two direct objects, as in I'll give you some money, Araki would have one complement as a direct object, while the other would be assigned the oblique case. Therefore, one complement appears inside the VP and the other outside it.\n\n\n==== Symmetrical verbs ====\nSome verbs in Araki allow its syntactic subject to be marked with either the case role of Patient or Agent.\n\nHowever, this phenomenon is more limited in Araki than it is in English.\n\n\n==== Verb serialization ====\nAraki allows two verb roots to appear in one single verb phrase, thus forming a sort of complex verb {V1, V2}; usually no more than two verbs can appear at a time. This series of two verbs share one mood-subject clitic and the same aspect markers. This does not imply that they semantically have the same subject. No object or other complement can insert between these two verbs. The transitivity suffix -i, as well as the object suffix, appear on the right of the second verb, provided this is authorized by the morphology of V2 and by the syntactic context.\nVerb serialization is much rarer in Araki than in many other Oceanic languages. It seems to be productive only when either of the two verbs is a movement verb. Another less seldom pattern, is when the second element is a stative verb or an adjective: V2 indicates the manner of V1.\nA much more frequent strategy in Araki is that of clause chaining.\n\n\n=== Personal markers ===\nIn the case of Araki, it is more appropriate to discuss \u2018personal markers\u2019 (rather than \u2018pronouns\u2019). There are seven morphosyntactic person markings: first, second, third, and in the case of non-singular first person, there is an inclusive/exclusive distinction.\n\n\n==== Independent pronouns ====\n\n\n==== Subject clitics and person markers ====\nThe following table shows the clitics that provide ordinary marking of subjects in verbal sentences. They express two moods: realis and irrealis.\n\nWhether the mood is coded as realis or irrealis depends on the modality of the verb phrase.\n\n\n=== Numerals ===\nNumerals behave syntactically like (intransitive) verbs, and could be argued to form a subset of verbal lexemes. They must always be introduced by a subject clitic, which is sensitive to person and modality (Realis/Irrealis).\n\n\n==== Cardinal numbers ====\nNumerals are listed in the following table:\n\n\n==== Ordinal numbers ====\nOrdinal numbers are formed with the prefix ha-, at least for the numbers 2-5. Greater numbers have already integrated this - or a similar - prefix ha- to their radical.\nThe number 'one' has a suppletive form mudu 'first'.\nThe ordinal forms are used especially with the word dan(i), to form the days of the weeks:\n\n\n=== Adjectives ===\nContrary to many languages which lack a distinct category of adjectives, Araki does have a set of lexemes which can be named this way. The lexical category of adjectives is defined by two basic principles: \n\nadjectives can be predicates, and in this case must be preceded by a subject clitic, like numerals or verbs;\nadjectives can modify directly a noun in a Noun Phrase, without a subject clitic (opp. numerals) or a relative structure (opp. verbs).Adjectives always follow the noun they modify, and come before numerals.\n\n\n=== Adjuncts ===\nAdjuncts form quite a small category of lexical items whose syntactic position is to follow immediately the verb radical, though still within the verb phrase. When the verb is transitive, adjuncts are inserted between the verb radical and the transitiviser suffix and/or the object suffixes, as though they were incorporated:\n\n\n=== Adverbs ===\nContrary to adjuncts, which are always incorporated into the verb phrase, adverbs never are. They can appear either at the beginning or at the end of a clause. The unmarked position of a (non-typical) adverb is after the verb\u2013object bundle, where prepositional phrases are too. The category of adverbs includes all words which form directly - that is, without a preposition - an oblique complement.\n\n\n=== Demonstratives ===\nDemonstratives are associated either to nouns for reference tracking, or have the whole clause as their scope. Although they syntactically behave partially like locational adverbs, demonstrative words form a specific paradigm, which is easily identified morphologically.\n\n\n=== Reduplication ===\nAraki uses reduplication in order to present a notion as intense, multiple or plural in one way or another. Semantically, verbal reduplication triggers features such as non-referentiality/genericity of the object, and thus is generally associated with noun incorporation. Reduplication is also the main device, if not the only one, which allows a word to change its syntactic category. Reduplication occurs: \n\nFrom noun to noun (indicating plurality, and sometimes a diminutive capacity ('Many Ns, 'small Ns'). e.g. naru 'son' \u2192 nanaru 'sons', hudara 'dirt' \u2192 hudahudara 'small particles of dirt'\nFrom noun to verb or adjective (referring not to an of the world, but to a process/state which is normally caused by it). e.g. alo 'sun' \u2192 aloalo 'to be sunny'\nFrom verb to verb (deriving one of the following: an intensified meaning, plurality, reflexivity, distributivity, imperfectivity, detransitivity). e.g. v\u0308ano 'walk' \u2192 v\u0308anov\u0308ano 'race'\nFrom verb to noun (referring to the very notion of the verb, in general terms)e.g. sodo 'talk; \u2192 sodosodo 'speech, message, language'.Structurally, Araki has three types of reduplication\n\n\n==== CV reduplication ====\nThe first syllable of the word is reduplicated.\n\nnaru    \u2192 nanaru    ('son', 'sons')\nlokudo  \u2192 lolokudo  ('angry')\nlevosai \u2192 lelevosai ('intelligent')\n\n\n==== CVCV reduplication ====\nThe first two syllables of the word are reduplicated.\n\nm\u0308arahu \u2192 m\u0308aram\u0308arahu ('fear', 'be afraid')\nveculu \u2192 vecuveculu ('colour')\nhudara \u2192 hudahudara ('dirt', 'small particles of dirt')\n\n\n==== Root reduplication ====\nThe entire root of the word is reduplicated.\n\ndev\u0308e \u2192 dev\u0308edev\u0308e ('pull')\nalo  \u2192 aloalo   ('sun', 'to be sunny')\nsodo \u2192 sodosodo ('talk', 'speech, message, language')\n\n\n== Clause structure ==\nAs mentioned above, Araki is a strict SVO language. This means that different sentence types, such as assertives, imperatives and interrogatives do not involve a change in word order. This, contrary to what occurs in European languages. These sentence types may differ in other ways.\n\n\n=== Imperatives ===\nAll imperative sentences take Irrealis modality, by definition, since they refer to virtual events. The verb must be preceded by its subject clitic. \n\nThus, except for prosody, all imperative sentences are formally identical with sentences expressing an intent or a near future (for example, 'you should help me' or ' you are going to help me').\nA negative order does not use the usual negation marker ce, but the modal clitic kan 'Prohibitive':\n\n\n=== Interrogatives ===\nInterrogative sentences can take either Realis or Irrealis modality. \nYes/No questions are similar to the corresponding question, except for prosody. \nQuite often, the interrogative is marked by a final tag ... vo mo-ce-re ... 'or not?'.  \nIn WH-questions, the interrogative words take the same slot as the word they replace (that is, they remain in-situ.\nArakian Interrogative words include sa 'what', se 'who', v\u0308e 'where', gisa 'when', and visa 'how many'. The interrogative article ('what X, which') is sava, a longer form of sa. It comes before a noun, for example sava hina 'what thing'. Two interrogative words are derived from sa 'what': sohe sa 'like what \u2192 how' and m\u0308ara sa 'because of what \u2192 why'.\n\n\n=== Negation ===\nThe general negation marker is a single morpheme ce, which is used in all negative sentences except imperative. It always comes at the beginning of the predicate phrase, following the subject clitic. It can be combined to Realis or Irrealis mood.\nThe negation ce combines with other elements, for example aspect markers, to build complex negative morphemes. For example, \n\nNegation ce + aspect le 'again' \u2192 'no longer'\nNegation ce + aspect m\u0308isi 'still' \u2192 'not yet'\nNegation ce + partitive re 'some' \u2192 'not any'\nNegation ce + NP re hina 'some thing' \u2192 'nothing'\nNegation ce + adverb n-re-dan 'on some day' \u2192 'never'The combination {negation re + Verb + partitive re in object position}, has the frequent effect of implying the non-existence of this object. The construction {ce re + N} has been grammaticalised into a complect predicate ce re, meaning 'do not exist, not to be'.\n\n\n=== Existential sentences ===\nSince the combination ce re has generalized to form a negative existential predicate, one could expect that, in a second stage of evolution, affirmative existential sentences (that is, 'there is N') would simply use the same predicate re without the negation. In fact, this is normally impossible. \nAffirmative existential sentences never use re, but have to employ other strategies. These include the use of the predicate mo hese 'one', or a locative phrase.\n\n\n== Complex sentences ==\n\n\n=== Coordination ===\nCoordination as a clause-linker is far from being widespread in Araki: clause-chaining is by far the preferred strategy. Nevertheless, some coordinators exist, whose meaning is more precise than just 'and'.\nThe most frequent coordinator is pani ~ pan 'and, but', which usually carries an adversive meaning: \n\nThe word for 'or' is voni ~ von ~ vo.\nM\u0308ara 'because' can be said to have coordinating effects.\nFrequent use is made of the Bislama coordinator 'ale (derived from the French allez). Possible meanings are 'OK; then; now; so; finally'.\nNP coordination 'X and Y' can be translated into Araki in three different ways: \n\nthe noun-like preposition nida- 'with';\nthe comitative suffix -n(i), only with free pronouns;\nthe numeral rolu 'three \u2192 and', with personal pronouns.\n\n\n=== Conditional systems ===\nAraki has three markers corresponding to English 'if': vada, aru, code. Surprisingly, two of these three markers are compatible with Realis modality.\n\nCo de 'suppose, let us say that \u2192 if' is the only marker that is incompatible with Realis modality. It can refer to a possible situation in the future, or it can present a counter-factual hypothesis about the present.\nAru appears only with Realis modality in the conditional clause (the main clause may bear Realis or Irrealis marking). It can refer either to a possible hypothesis about the future, or to a counter-factual situation in the past.\nVada is a common subordinator in Araki, probably deriving etymologically from the root vadai 'say, tell'. When used in a topic clause, vada is most often associated to Realis mood. It can refer either to a single event in the past (English 'when'), to a generic event in the global situation (English 'whenever'), or to a possible event in the future (English 'when', 'if', 'in case').\n\n\n=== Clause chaining ===\nClause chaining is the combination of at least two clauses (C1 and C2), without any coordinator, subordinator or any other kind of overt link between them. On prosodic criteria, no pause is audible at their boundary, at least no such pause as between two autonomous sentences. Contrary to verb serialization, every verb must be preceded by its own subject clitic, whether or not it refers to the same subject as the preceding verb. A sentence like the following is perfectly common in Araki: \n\nNotice the ambiguity of the sentence: it is only the context that makes clear that what falls down is actually the stone, not the man. The high frequency of clause chaining constructions makes the clitic mo (Third person Realis, singular or plural) by far the most frequent word encountered in actual discourse.\nClause chaining can be used to describe a wide variety of situations: \n\nTime succession and consequence;\nTwo phases of a single complex action;\nSimultaneity of two events;\nCommenting on an action;\nSpatial dynamics;\nTemporal dynamics;\nSentential objects;\nRelative clauses;\nNumeral phrases.\n\n\n== Unusual characteristics ==\nAraki is one of the few languages of Vanuatu, and indeed of the world, that has a set of linguolabial consonants.\nAraki lacks a row of voiced stops, as well as prenasalised stops, both of which are prevalent in the Oceanic language group.\nAraki has an unusually high number of phonemic differentiation on the alveolar point of articulation. Particularly notable is the existence of a contrast between the alveolar trill and the alveolar flap one.\n\n\n== Language preservation ==\nIn June 2008, the Jacques Chirac Foundation for Sustainable Development and Cultural Dialogue announced its intention to focus on preserving the Araki language. This language is cited as an example, among many others, of the situation of language endangerment which the Chirac Foundation aims at addressing, especially through its programme \u201cSorosoro: Pour que vivent les langues du monde\u201d. Sorosoro is itself an Araki word, meaning \u201cbreath, speech, language\u201d.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFran\u00e7ois, Alexandre (2002).

"Anonymity_(social_choice)| Social choice theory| ","In social choice theory, Anonymity is a basic requirement of a social choice rule.

For example, plurality voting is anonymous, since only counts the number of votes received by each candidates, regardless of who cast these votes. Similarly, the utilitarian rule and egalitarian rule are both anonymous, since the only consider the set of utilities, regardless of who these utilities belong to.\nAll rules using a secret ballot are anonymous, since they do not know which voter cast which vote. But the opposite is not true: a committee can use non-secret ballot, and still use an anonymous voting rule.\n\n\n== Non-anonymous rules ==\nWeighted voting rules are non-anonymous, as they give some voters a higher weight than others, for example, due to their expertise or entitlement.\nAnother example of a non-anonymous voting rule is plurality voting with the additional rule that, in case of a tie, the option preferred by the chair is selected.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNeutrality (social choice) - a related requirement, saying that the rule does not discriminate apriori between different candidates.\n\n\n== References =="

They were founded in 1953 to develop immunologically-based treatments for cancer, and despite their name are a funding body for research rather than a research institute themselves, working with other institutes and organizations. It was founded by Helen Coley Nauts and Oliver R. Grace with a $2,000 grant from Nelson Rockefeller. CRI was created in honor of Nauts' father, William Coley (1862\u20131936), an American orthopedic surgeon and a pioneer of cancer immunotherapy. Like Dr. Coley, the Institute focuses on immunological treatments for cancer, rather than traditional treatments, such as chemotherapy and surgery.\nThe organization offers research grants to students, postdoctoral fellows, and investigators at medical research institutions throughout the world. It also funds clinical trials testing promising immunotherapies in a variety of cancer types and convenes scientific conferences for tumor immunologists. In the fiscal year to June 2015, CRI reported income of $41.3 million and spending of $39 million: $29 million on research, $5 million on education, and $4 million on fundraising and administration.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThe institute makes a number of awards for excellence in the field of cancer research.William B.

His career has spanned the fields of journalism, politics, public service, the cooperative sector, strategy consulting, international development and dispute resolution.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAgnew was born in Sherbrooke, Quebec, and was raised in Toronto.  At 15, he became a sports reporter for the Toronto Sun and after finishing high school went to St. John's, Newfoundland to join the newsroom of the Evening Telegram.  A year later he enrolled as a full-time student at Memorial University of Newfoundland, graduating in 1979 with a Bachelor of Arts degree and the gold medal in political science.\n\n\n== Public service ==\nAfter a brief stint at the Toronto bureau of Canadian Press, in 1979 he was selected as a parliamentary intern at the House of Commons in Ottawa.  He worked for Members of Parliament Bob Rae, then the finance critic for the New Democratic Party, and Jim Peterson of the Liberal Party.  A year later, after he had rejoined Canadian Press to work at its Ottawa and Edmonton bureaux, Rae hired him as his executive assistant in Ottawa.  In 1982, Rae was elected as leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party and Agnew moved with him to Queen's Park in Toronto.  He served Rae as policy advisor, speechwriter, communications director and executive assistant before being named principal secretary to the Leader of the Official Opposition in 1990.\nIn June, 1990, Premier David Peterson called an early election three years into his term and Agnew was appointed campaign director for the NDP.  The campaign ended in an NDP majority government, the first time the NDP had become government in the province.  Rae appointed Agnew principal secretary to the Premier and as the main liaison with the public service.  In 1992, Rae appointed Agnew as secretary to the cabinet, a controversial move, to ensure the government's agenda was being implemented by the public service. In 1995, the Rae government was defeated by the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party led by Mike Harris.\n\n\n== Post-government careers ==\nAfter a transition between the Rae and Harris governments that was directed by Agnew, he was seconded to the University of Toronto.  He joined Massey College as a senior resident and was named deputy minister of the Public-Private Partnerships Project advising the new premier.  In 1996 Agnew joined Credit Union Central of Ontario as executive vice-president and corporate secretary.  Three years later, he was recruited by Don Tapscott to Digital4Sight to head up a global research initiative, Governance in the Digital Economy, looking at the impact of technology on democracy and government. He later helped develop the firm\u2019s public sector consulting practice.\nIn 2002 Agnew was appointed as president and CEO of UNICEF Canada, the first head of the organization recruited from outside the development sector.  During his time at UNICEF he raised the organization\u2019s profile in the media and with donors by bringing home accounts of his extensive field visits to the world\u2019s troubled areas, including Darfur in Sudan, Eastern Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Zimbabwe and Indonesia following the devastating tsunami in late 2004. UNICEF\u2019s revenues that year rose to $64.9 million from $28.3 million the year prior.In 2005 he accepted an appointment as the Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments, heading the national financial industry dispute resolution service for consumers and small businesses.  Over four years as ombudsman he expanded the reach of the service, including bringing in new rules governing how disputes are handled by member firms. In 2009 he became the fifth president of Seneca, one of Canada\u2019s largest colleges.\n\n\n== Community service ==\nAgnew is chair of CADTH, the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technology in Health, and chair of Polytechnics Canada.  He serves on numerous other boards and committees including ventureLAB, the International Advisory Board of Sichuan University, China and the Canadian Ditchley Foundation Advisory Board.  He also participated in the Council on Foreign Relations Higher Education Working Group.  Agnew is the past chair of the board of directors of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and past chair of Colleges Ontario, the provincial association of publicly assisted colleges. He served as a member of the Science, Technology and Innovation Council of Canada from 2010 to 2013 and was vice-chair of EQAO, the Education Quality and Accountability Office, from 2018 to 2020.  He is also a past member of the board of directors of Colleges and Institutes Canada, the Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council (TRIEC), the Empire Club of Canada, the Canadian Centre for Financial Literacy and served as the chair of the jury for the 1996 Lionel Gelber Prize for the world\u2019s best non-fiction book in English on foreign affairs.\nIn 2012, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal for his public and community service and in 2018 received the Award of Distinction from the Public Affairs Association of Canada.\n\n\n== References =="

He was the son of Abd al-Rahim Biy and the nephew of Abdul Karim Biy.\n\n\n== Rise to power ==\nAfter the death of Abdul Karim Biy in 1750 Erdeni was made the Khan of Kokand after slaying Abdurakhman-Batir and all of his family in Kokand except his young son Narbuta who was visiting his grandmother. After another prolonged power struggle that lasted roughly ten months between 1752 and 1753 in which Bobobek seized power and held the title of Khan, Irdana took back the title of Khan and removed Bobobek from office.\n\n\n== Policies as Khan ==\nIrdana Biy took active measures to expand the borders of the Khanate, briefly annexing the land of Ura-Tyube long coveted by the Khanate; Ura-Tyube ended up changing hands multiple times to and from Kokand throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. On his second attempt to annex Ura-Tyube he was more successful in capturing the territory, brutalizing prisoners of war by chopping off their heads and constructing a tower out of their heads.After various wars in attempts to expand the Khanate and Irdana's use of the title Khan instead of Bek, the Qing began to demand tribute from Kokand in the form of livestock and people; the Qing had informed the Khan of the Kazakh Middle Horde that they intended to take over Samarkand and most of Turkestan. When Irdana was informed of the plan of the Qing to take over most of Central Asia, he managed to unite the previously warring militaries of an Afghan monarch, several Kyrgyz biys and well as those of Khujand, Ura-Tyube on the premise of saving the Islamic world from takeover.

"Demographics_of_Turkey| Demographics of Turkey| ","This article is about the demographic features of the population of Turkey, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the population of Turkey was 84.7 million with a growth rate of 0.55% per annum. Turkish people are the largest ethnic group, followed by Kurds.\nThe population is relatively young, with 22.4% falling in the 0\u201314 age bracket. According to OECD/World Bank population statistics, from 1990 to 2008 the population growth in Turkey was 16 million or 29%.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Life expectancy ===\n\nSource: UN\n\n\n== Vital statistics ==\n\n\n=== UN estimates ===\nThe figures from the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs:\n\n\n=== Registered births and deaths ===\nBirth statistics of Turkey from 2001 onward are from the Central Population Administrative System (MERNIS) database which is available on-line. Birth statistics are updated continually because MERNIS has dynamic structure.In 2010 Turkey had a crude birth rate of 17.2 per 1000, in 2011 16.7, down from 20.3 in 2001. The total fertility rate (TFR) in 2010 was 2.05 children per woman, in 2011 2.02. The crude birth rate in 2010 ranged from 11.5 per 1,000 in West Marmara (TFR 1.52) (11,5;1.55 in 2011), similar to neighbouring Bulgaria, to 27.9 per 1,000 in Southeast Anatolia (TFR 3.53) (27.1;3,42 in 2011), similar to neighbouring Syria.

After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and following Turkish War of Independence, an exodus by the large portion of Turkish (Turkic) and Muslim peoples from the Balkans (Balkan Turks, Albanians, Bosniaks, Pomaks), Caucasus (Abkhazians, Ajarians, Circassians, Chechens), Crimea (Crimean Tatar diaspora), and Crete (Cretan Turks) took refuge in present-day Turkey and moulded the country's fundamental features. Trends of immigration towards Turkey continue to this day, although the motives are more varied and are usually in line with the patterns of global immigration movements \u2014 Turkey, for example, receives many economic migrants from nearby countries such as Armenia, the Moldova, Georgia, Iran, and Azerbaijan, but also from Central Asia, Ukraine and Russia. Turkey's migrant crisis during the 2010s saw high numbers of people arriving in Turkey, particularly those fleeing the Syrian civil war.\n\n\n== Internal migration ==\n\n\n== Ethnic groups and languages ==\n\nNo exact data is available concerning the different ethnic groups in Turkey. The last census data according to language date from 1965 and major changes may have occurred since then. However, it is clear that the Turkish are in the majority, while the largest minority groups are Kurds and Arabs. Smaller minorities are the Armenians, Greeks and others. All ethnic groups are discussed below.\n\nThe word Turk or Turkish also has a wider meaning in a historical context because, at times, especially in the past, it has been used to refer to all Muslim inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire irrespective of their ethnicity.\nThe question of ethnicity in modern Turkey is a highly debated and difficult issue. Figures published in several different sources prove this difficulty by varying greatly.\nIt is necessary to take into account all these difficulties and be cautious while evaluating the ethnic groups. A possible list of ethnic groups living in Turkey could be as follows:\nTurkic-speaking peoples: Turks, Azerbaijanis, Tatars, Karachays, Uzbeks, Crimean Tatars and Uyghurs\nIndo-European-speaking peoples: Kurds, Zazas, Megleno-Romanians, Bosniaks, Albanians, Pomaks, Ossetians, Armenians, Hamshenis, Goranis and Greeks\nSemitic-speaking peoples: Arabs, Jews and Assyrians/Syriacs\nCaucasian-speaking peoples: Circassians, Georgians, Lazs and ChechensAccording to the 2016 edition of the CIA World Factbook, 70-75% of Turkey's population consists of ethnic Turks, with Kurds accounting for 19% and other minorities between 7 and 12%.\nAccording to Milliyet, a 2008 report prepared for the National Security Council of Turkey by academics of three Turkish universities in eastern Anatolia suggested that there are approximately 55 million ethnic Turks, 9.6 million Kurds, 3 million Zazas, 2.5 million Circassians, 2 million Bosniaks, 500,000-1.3 million Albanians, 1,000,000 Georgians, 870,000 Arabs, 600,000 Pomaks, 80,000 Laz, 60,000 Armenians, 30,000 British, 25,000 Assyrians/Syriacs, 20,000 Jews, and 15,000 Greeks, 500 Yazidis living in Turkey.Since the immigration to the big cities in the west of Turkey, interethnic marriage has become more common. A recent study estimates that there are 2,708,000 marriages between Turks and Kurds.According to a survey done in March 2020 by Area Ara\u015ft\u0131rma, 20.4% of the total population of Turkey claim to be Kurdish (either Kurmanji speaking or Zazaki speaking).\nEthnolinguistic estimates in 2014 by Ethnologue and Jacques Leclerc:\nScale of Ethnologue:\n\na^ Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (EGIDS) of Ethnologue:\n0 (International): \"

It was produced in 1988 and premiered at film festivals throughout the next year. The story is set in a rundown area of Buenos Aires at the dawn of the 1980s, where Adrian LeDuc becomes friends with Jack Carney, an American expatriate who rents a room from him. Gradually, Adrian begins to suspect that the outwardly likeable Jack is responsible for a series of political assassinations that are rocking the city.\nFamously suffused with homoerotic overtones and moments of black comedy, it received mixed-to-positive reviews at the time of its release, and currently has a Rotten Tomatoes' score of 74% positive reactions from both critics and viewers.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAdrian LeDuc (Firth) is the British owner of a revival house in Buenos Aires. Apart from his mother, the core of his emotional life is movies, specifically classic American movies and stars. The story begins with Adrian in his theater, watching the final scene of Touch of Evil.\nAs his theater loses more and more money, Adrian advertises for a roommate to share his apartment rent. After several unsatisfactory applicants, he meets American Jack Carney (Bochner), who agrees to take the room.  The shy, repressed Adrian is both intimidated by and attracted to Jack, who exudes confidence and strength, and attempts to win Jack's trust and companionship.  Jack seems to suspect this and doesn't mind, and he takes a liking to his new landlord.\nJack befriends some of the neighbors. Adrian complains to Jack, telling him that the neighbors aren't to be trusted. Despite Adrian's jealousy, Jack continues to socialize with several of them, becoming sexually involved with Laura, whose husband is frequently away. Claudia, the ticket seller at Adrian's cinema, is involved with a political committee investigating a series of murders that bear a striking resemblance to those committed by members of death squads that operated in Argentina during its last civil-military dictatorship (1976\u20131983).\nAdrian learns that Jack has been lying about his employment and becomes paranoid that Jack is spying on him. He searches Jack's room and finds a number of photographs of Jack in paramilitary garb. Jack returns and calms a highly agitated Adrian, but his own suspicions are aroused when he realizes that Adrian has been in his room.\nThough he's personally apolitical, Adrian allows Claudia's committee to use his theatre to view footage of death squad members. Adrian is horrified to see the same sign in the film as appeared in some of the photos of Jack he'd found earlier. Jack, realizing that Adrian is growing more suspicious, falsifies Adrian's passport and prepares to leave Argentina. Unfortunately, the passport is expired and he can't leave. Jack picks up a young gay man and murders him for his passport\u2014but then makes a hash of trying to paste his own photos into the dead man's passport.\nMeanwhile, Adrian is devastated by the death of his mother. Adrian gets drunk and creates a disturbance in his apartment, concerning his neighbors. The following morning a television report of the murder of a young man leads the neighbors to think that Adrian has done something to Jack. That evening, the neighbors confront Adrian, forcing their way into his apartment and physically attacking him. Jack returns and tends to the badly injured Adrian.\nAs Adrian attends his mother's funeral, Claudia comes to the apartment and recognizes Jack from the death squad photos. Adrian returns to find Claudia dead at Jack's hands. A clearly unhinged Adrian, who is as terrified of losing Jack as he is horrified by Claudia's murder, helps Jack dispose of the body. On the way out they run into Laura and her husband. Looking for an alibi, Jack says he's leaving for California in the morning.\nAfter they dump the body in a garbage landfill outside the city, Adrian suggests they really go to California together and Jack agrees. Back at the apartment Adrian changes his mind and goes for Jack's gun in the living room. Jack realizes what's happening and begins strangling Adrian, but eventually lets him up. Adrian again goes for the gun and he and Jack struggle. With the gun pointed at him and with Adrian's finger on the trigger, Jack says \"

It is situated beyond the western front of the York Mountains. It is a dissected plateau which stands at an elevation of about 600 feet (180 m). The top of the plateau is smooth and hard. The larger streams within the plateau have rather broad valleys, which are cut down nearly to sea level, while the smaller tributaries flow in canyons. To the south, the plateau ends in a steep escarpment which is separated from the Bering Sea by a narrow coastal plain or beach. Near the settlement of York, the coastal plain has an elevation of about 50 feet (15 m), and above this is a higher bench at about 400 feet (120 m), which is similar to the plateau in character, but not so extensive. The plateau seems to slope more gradually to the Arctic Ocean, from which it is separated by a coastal plain which extends inland for several miles. A wide lagoon separates this coastal plain from the Arctic Ocean. The surface of the plateau is covered with a thin layer of semiangular gravels.\n\n\n== References =="

It is played by up to six players in seven epochs (6 epochs in the 2009 edition, and 5 epochs in the 2018 edition), each player playing a different empire in each epoch.\n\n\n== Brief history ==\nThe first edition of History of the World by Ragnar Brothers was released in 1991 (with a tea-towel board).  This first edition sold out in a few weeks, according to Game Designer, Steve Kendall. Following English, Dutch and German versions by various publishers, it was published by Avalon Hill in 1993.  After Avalon Hill was purchased by Hasbro in the early 2000s, History of the World was re released as a big box game. Ragnar Brothers released a revised version of the game, A Brief History of the World, in 2009. The Game was then handed to Z-Man Games who created the most recent edition in 2018. The 2018 version contains updated art and is considered the most visually appealing of all the versions. \n\n\n== Game play ==\nThe game is played in seven rounds known as epochs (6 epochs in the 2009 edition, and 5 epochs in the 2018 edition), which correspond to different historical periods.  At the beginning of each epoch, each player receives an empire card and assumes the role of that empire for the round. Each empire has advantages and disadvantages based on the order in which it appears in an epoch, starting location on the world map, its number of armies, navigation abilities (access to certain lands by sea), and whether or not it possesses a capital. Empires not having capitals are known as Marauders and they gain points for sacking other players structures.\nDuring each empire's turn, its allocated units are placed on the board beginning from its capital (or starting space) and proceeding through contiguous areas and controlled seas or oceans. Occupation of empty territory is automatic, while dice-based combat rules are applied if a unit is placed in an area already occupied by another player's forces.\nAt the end of each player's turn, they are given a score based on how much control they have of regions of the board (known as \"

It was designed in the 1820s, and was first created by Charles Babbage. The name, the difference engine, is derived from the method of divided differences, a way to interpolate or tabulate functions by using a small set of polynomial co-efficients. Some of the most common mathematical functions used in engineering, science and navigation, were, and still are computable with the use of the difference engine's capability of computing logarithmic and trigonometric functions, which can be approximated by polynomials, so a difference engine can compute many useful tables of numbers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe notion of a mechanical calculator for mathematical functions can be traced back to the Antikythera mechanism of the 2nd century BC, while early modern examples are attributed to Pascal and Leibniz in the 17th century. \nIn 1784 J.

He was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. He was the last Catholic monarch of England, Scotland, and Ireland. His reign is now remembered primarily for struggles over religious tolerance, but it also involved struggles over the principles of absolutism and the divine right of kings. His deposition ended a century of political and civil strife in England by confirming the primacy of the English Parliament over the Crown.James inherited the thrones of England, Ireland, and Scotland from his brother with widespread support in all three countries, largely because the principles of eligibility based on divine right and birth were widely accepted. Tolerance of his personal Catholicism did not extend to tolerance of Catholicism in general, and the English and Scottish Parliaments refused to pass his measures. When James attempted to impose them by decree, this was met with opposition; some academics have however argued that it was a political principle, rather than a religious one, that ultimately led to his removal.In June 1688, two events turned dissent into a crisis; the first, on 10 June, was the birth of James's son and heir James Francis Edward, which raised the prospect of initiating a Roman Catholic dynasty and excluding his Anglican daughter Mary and her Protestant husband William III of Orange. The second was the prosecution of the Seven Bishops for seditious libel; this was viewed as an assault on the Church of England and their acquittal on 30 June destroyed his political authority in England. The anti-Catholic riots in England and Scotland that ensued led to a general feeling that only his removal from the throne could prevent a civil war.Leading members of the English political class invited William of Orange to assume the English throne; after he landed in Brixham on 5 November 1688, James's army deserted, and he went into exile in France on 23 December.

It is endemic to Pehuenche Valley in the Andes of southern Mendoza Province, Argentina, and the adjacent Chile. At the time of the assessment by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2012 (published 2013), the species was known from six streams (five in Argentina and one in Chile) in an area encompassing some 9 km\u00b2. A study published in 2013 extended the known range a few kilometers west and included another Chilean stream.\n\n\n== Habitat ==\nAlsodes pehuenche is an aquatic frog. It is found primarily in galleries inside small permanent snowmelt streams with stony banks, covered by herbaceous vegetation; it can also be found in ponds and swamps derived from snowmelt. The altitude of its habitat is between 2,000\u20132,523 m (6,562\u20138,278 ft) asl.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMales in two Chilean locations measured on average 51 mm (2.0 in) and females 50.4 mm (1.98 in) in snout\u2013vent length. The body is bulky and extremities are robust. The head is wide with snout that is short and rounded. The dorsal coloration is light brown with diffuse, irregular, darker blotches.

"Albuquerque_Police_Department| Albuquerque Police Department| Municipal police departments of New Mexico| Government of Albuquerque, New Mexico| Government agencies established in 1880| 1880 establishments in New Mexico Territory| ","The Albuquerque Police Department (APD) is the largest municipal police department in New Mexico. It is located in Bernalillo County and has jurisdiction within the city limits of Albuquerque (the area immediately outside the city limits, in the unincorporated area of Bernalillo County, is policed by the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office). In addition to their regular commissions (as city police officers), Albuquerque police officers are sworn in as special deputy sheriffs by the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office, which allows officers to enforce laws outside of the city limits.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe city's first police chief, J.R. Galusha, was appointed in 1916. Starting in 1881, the unincorporated town of Albuquerque had been patrolled by a succession of marshals, aided by volunteer watchmen.\n\n\n=== 1970-2000 ===\nThe decade of the 1970s began for the department with the retirement of Chief Paul Shaver, the city's longest-serving police chief. Shaver had led the department for the preceding 23 years, after starting his career as a patrol officer in 1933. After Shaver's retirement in June 1971, the city was rocked by rioting following the arrest of several students by police for public intoxication. The ensuing three-day melee was brought under control only after the deployment of the New Mexico National Guard. Thirteen civilians were shot during the disorder, some by police officers and some by private citizens repelling the sporadic looting that accompanied the unrest.\nIn 1973, the Chicano Police Officers' Association of Albuquerque and twelve Albuquerque police officers sued the city in federal court, alleging that Hispanic-surnamed applicants were discriminated against in hiring and promotion practices of the police department. The lawsuit survived adverse testimony and several motions to dismiss and even went up to the Supreme Court of the United States before being scheduled for trial in 1978.On May 15, 1978, the parties agreed to a stipulated judgment which required the city to pay $8,000 to Beserra and $8,000 to the Chicano Police Officers' Association and to meet an affirmative action goal of 34% Hispanic-surnamed people in the police department by July 1, 1981, and also to complete an affirmative action internal audit of the police department to verifiably validate the testing procedures for promotion. The department was also to assign a Chicano police officer to the police academy; and expand department language and cultural awareness training. After the settlement was approved, the lawyers for the Chicano Police Officers' Association asked for more money from the city for attorney's fees, and over the dissent of Chief Judge Seth, the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court ordered them to be paid. Despite the settlement, complaints continued even into the 1990s. However, the 34% target had been exceeded by 1993 with a 39.4% Hispanic-surnamed force.In 1976, Albuquerque police coordinated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Operation Fiesta. The year-long series of undercover investigations and stings, funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, targeted the fencing operations then prolific in the Albuquerque area, resulting in 79 arrests.\n\n\n=== Modern Era ===\nBetween 2010 and 2013 the number of police employed by the city of Albuquerque plummeted by more than 15% as a result of officer resignations, a drop attributed to pay cuts imposed by the city to balance a budget deficit, and low department morale.Albuquerque's police department entered an extended period of public controversy beginning in 2010 after revelations of financial impropriety in the police officers' union, and repeated high cash settlements to people sued the department for reasons from wrongful death to whistleblower harassment. In addition, the department had the highest rates of officer-involved shootings in the United States for a city its size. News that the police union had been routinely providing cash payments to officers involved in shootings to help them recover emotionally from the event, further heightened public scrutiny.In January 2010 APD officer Brett Lampiris-Tremba shot Kenneth Ellis III, an Iraq veteran threatening to commit suicide at a 7-11. Another officer shot a man who was cutting himself with a dull butter knife at the bus station downtown. Lampis-Tremba shot another man in the back in 2011, and two of his fellow officers were caught on a security camera repeatedly kicking an unarmed man in the head then doing high-fives over his body when the man lost consciousness. Then police shot a man holding a spoon standing in the doorway of his brother's house. DOJ noted that APD was especially likely to unconstitutionally use excess force against the mentally ill and citizens too intoxicated or developmentally impaired to comply with officers' orders.\n\nIn November 2012, a union-sponsored survey of Albuquerque police officers found that all but 3 of the 456 department personnel who responded to the questionnaire characterized morale as \"

Gonz\u00e1lez, Baigorr\u00eda, and Campana streets.\nVilla Devoto, a primarily middle class to upscale neighborhood, is characterized by quiet tree-lined streets and is often considered as The Garden of Buenos Aires. A lower-density, wealthy residential subsection known as Devoto R is located around Arenales Square, in the ward's north-central section.\nVilla Devoto is served by the FC Urquiza and FC San Mart\u00edn commuter railway lines.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPart of General San Mart\u00edn Partido until the Federalization of Buenos Aires, the area was an exurb at the time and was known as Villa Gainza y Lynch. A rail link was built by the Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway, which inaugurated Devoto Station in 1888.\nThe district was named after Count Antonio Devoto, who became the landowner of most of the present day district in 1904. The Count Devoto was a member of the elite of Buenos Aires. King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy granted Devoto the title of count in 1916 in gratitude for his assistance to the Kingdom of Italy during World War I; Devoto died a few months later.\nDevoto owned one of the largest mansions of Buenos Aires, known as Devoto Palace. The mansion was built by Italian architect Juan Antonio Buschiazzo, its 10,000 m\u00b2 (107,000 ft\u00b2) decorated in bronze, silver and gold with ironwork forged in Italy, as well as Florentine mosaics. Prince Umberto di Savoia stayed there during a state visit in 1924. Devoto died before Buschiazzo's work was complete, and the mansion was demolished around 1940. He did not leave any descendants, and his remains lie at the Bas\u00edlica of San Antonio de Padua in Villa Devoto.\nThe Metropolitan Seminary of Buenos Aires, alma mater to many of Argentina's bishops and archbishops, was established in Villa Devoto in 1899; among its alumni was the future Pope Francis. The Devoto Penitentiary, the city's sole remaining jail, was established in 1927. The ward became a bedroom community in later decades, as well as home to a sizable English Argentine and American expatriate community; a Garden Club was established by the English-speaking community in 1978.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nVilla Devoto is home to the General Lamadrid soccer club.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\n\n== Personalities ==\nJorge Bergoglio, the 266th and current Pope of the Catholic Church studied in 1958 at the Metropolitan Seminary of Villa Devoto.The following have all been residents of Villa Devoto:\n\nOlegario V\u00edctor Andrade, poet\nJosemar\u00eda Listorti, TV comedian\nDiego Maradona, footballer\nMario Pergolini, TV producer\nGabriela Sabatini, tennis player\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAntonio Devoto\nDevoto Palace\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Portal Of Villa Devoto (Spanish)\nDevoto Info (Spanish)\nDevoto News (Spanish)\nDevoto Barrio (Spanish)\nDevoto Hoy Portal (Spanish)\nInfo on Devoto (Spanish)"

"Canuck_the_Crow| Individual birds| Crows| SkyTrain (Vancouver)| ","Canuck the Crow (hatched 2015 \u2013 disappeared 30 August 2019) is a human-habituated, wild Northwestern Crow from East Vancouver, British Columbia who became locally well known due to his close relationship with people and various stunts including stealing a knife from a crime scene and riding the Vancouver SkyTrain. He was voted Metro Vancouver's unofficial ambassador in 2018, and disappeared in August 2019.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Notoriety ===\nAs a hatchling, Canuck was pushed from his nest. He was rescued and raised by a young boy in Vancouver, who took care of him until he could fly and attached a red zip-tie to his leg before letting him free in 2015.Canuck was well known in his neighbourhood, but first went viral in September 2015 when he landed on a cyclist and started investigating his backpack. During a soccer tournament at Empire Field, Canuck landed on spectator's shoulders, tried to take personal items including keys, and drank Tim Horton's coffee.In January 2016, Global News producer Nick Logan filmed Canuck travelling via the Vancouver SkyTrain, an automated rapid transit system. He had entered on Millennium Line at the Commercial-Broadway station and got off in East Vancouver, having also done so on two dates prior.On 24 May 2016, Canuck stole a knife from a crime scene and interrupted a police investigation. Police had been responding to a burning vehicle when a man came at them with a knife and was subsequently shot and brought to hospital. While police were still on the scene, Canuck picked up the dropped knife, but dropped it before flying off. During another police investigation, Canuck investigated the parked police motorcycles and entered a police van, in which he defecated.Due to the visibility and uniqueness of Canuck's actions, he became legendary in Vancouver. He was named by CBC viewers as Metro Vancouver's unofficial ambassador in 2018, beating out actor Michael J. Fox with 81% of the final vote.\n\n\n=== Personal life ===\nIn March 2017, Canuck was beaten unconscious on a soccer pitch by a man using a flagpole. He was nursed back to health by veterinarian Anne McDonald. Canuck mated with a female crow named Cassiar and had two broods in May and June 2019. The first brood died due to a predatory bird attack but the second was successful. One of the chicks, named Gord after late Canadian singer-songwriter Gord Downie, was plucked from the nest by another crow, but was rehabilitated and adopted by another crow pair in Maple Ridge.\n\n\n=== Disappearance ===\nCanuck was last seen on 30 August 2019. His mate Cassiar remained at their nest site, calling for him to return. Shawn Bergman, the operator of Canuck's social media profiles, posted a $10,000 reward for the safe return of Canuck, with money gathered from anonymous donations. Bergman and others have expressed belief that Canuck was kidnapped. Wildlife biologist and crow specialist John Marzluff has stated that the chances Canuck is still alive are slim. Reports of dead crows matching Canuck's description have remained unverified. Vancouver police are not investigating the disappearance.\n\n\n== References =="

He was given his first musical training at home under his mother's care, then starting from the age of seven under Worms' musical director, Louis Liebe, a former pupil of Louis Spohr.  His father, a prominent Jewish physician, moved the family to Frankfurt am Main in the aftermath of the year of revolutions, 1848, where he studied with Edward Rosenhain, brother of Jakob Rosenhain. He made his first public appearance as a concert pianist in 1850 and toured for two seasons, then settled with his family in Leipzig, where he studied piano with Ignaz Moscheles from 1852. He spent the years 1855\u20131860 in Paris, meeting Gioachino Rossini, Th\u00e9odore Gouvy, \u00c9douard Lalo and Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHis travels afterwards took him to Saarbr\u00fccken, where in 1861 he took the conductor post vacated by Hermann Levi; to Cologne, where in 1865 Ferdinand Hiller appointed him to the staff of the Conservatory (his pupils there included Engelbert Humperdinck and Carl Lachmund); he then served as musical director of the Philharmonic Society of  Rotterdam, 1874-1890. In the latter year he became a teacher at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin, and in 1897 moved there to teach at the Prussian Academy of Arts, where he was elected to the senate in 1897. In 1877 he married Helene Hernsheim from Karlsruhe.\nGernsheim was a prolific composer, especially of orchestral, chamber and instrumental music, and songs. Some of his works tend to Jewish subject-matter, but Gernsheim rarely made explicit references in his music to Jewish heritage. His third symphony, for example, was based on the legend of the Song of Miriam, but directly inspired by a performance of Handel\u2019s Israel in Egypt. His earlier works show the influence of Schumann, and from 1868, when he first became friendly with Brahms, a Brahmsian influence is very palpable. Gernsheim's four symphonies (the first of which was written before the publication of Brahms' First Symphony) are an interesting example of the reception of Brahmsian style by a sympathetic and talented contemporary.  Gernsheim's last works, most notably his Zu einem Drama (1902), show him moving away from that into something more personal. He died in Berlin.\nDue to his Jewish background, his work was banned in Nazi Germany, and his papers and a biography written about him by Karl Holl were removed from music libraries.\n\n\n== Style ==\nAccording to the few who have studied Friedrich Gernsheim\u2019s music, he is usually categorized as a Romantic composer heavily influenced by Johannes Brahms. While he certainly did learn from the great composer, Gernsheim began his composition career prior to hearing Brahms and his influence was only discovered later. Christopher Fifield suggests that Gernsheim owes his \u201cinstrumentation, thematic shapes, accompaniments, and orchestral textures\u201d to both Brahms and Max Bruch. In fact, some believe Gernsheim\u2019s symphonic work to resemble Bruch more than Brahms, but homages to both masters are present in his music. Unlike Bruch, however, Gernsheim is described as having his own \u201cpersonal melodic language\u201d and was more daring in his harmony, whereas Bruch was largely inspired by folk songs.\nAfter the premier of Gernsheim\u2019s first symphony, which predated Brahms\u2019s first symphony, Gernsheim\u2019s themes were praised for possessing an \u201cabundance of beautiful details,\u201d many of which pass by the listener unnoticed in the first hearing. The same critic claimed that his treatment of instrumentation \u201creveals a very talented hand,\u201d and many listeners preferred Gernsheim\u2019s symphonies to those by Brahms. Bruch, for one, considered Gernsheim\u2019s first symphony a work that \u201cranks without question among the best that has been written in this genre in our time.\u201d He even called Brahms\u2019s symphonies overrated and agreed with critics in that Gernsheim demonstrated a great advantage over those of his contemporaries: \u201cits excellent orchestration.\u201d\nOn the other hand, some of Gernsheim\u2019s critics and even his teacher, Ignaz Moscheles, said he fell into the same trap Bruckner did by composing short melodies or themes that were already too complicated to develop further. Granted, some of Gernsheim\u2019s themes can seem fleeting and disconnected since he often inserts short, transitional motives, but he achieves a high degree of contrast between themes through his use of transitions and silence. Moscheles also admitted, after playing Gernsheim\u2019s first piano quartet, that he composed \u201cwith great agility in the manner of Schumann\u201d and the Romantic style of the time, but thought his clear motives were often sacrificed to \u201cartificial counterpoint.\u201d Many theorists and music critics today agree with this evaluation of the composer, saying his symphonies and other works tend to be discursive, but all admire his talent in orchestration and achievements in chamber music. In chamber settings, he wrote particularly well for strings and presented his most focused ideas and logical developments. His late orchestral works, such as his fourth symphony and the tone poem Zu Einem Drama, demonstrate the maturity reached in his chamber music but on a larger scale.\nThroughout his career, Gernsheim proved himself a somewhat conservative composer and a faithful student of Classical form. He composed under the belief that every measure should be \u201cessential and inevitable,\u201d which is undoubtedly present in his later works. The discursive ideas with small-scale developments that brought him criticism are often used to add variety within traditional structures. His music that follows sonata-allegro form, for example, usually include at least three expositional themes that establish structural patterns and allow him to undermine them. Common threads and relationships can be traced through his many themes, however, and Gernsheim uses them to achieve a certain balance in his music. Alexander Ringer calls this virtue \u201cGediegenheit,\u201d or \u201cdecency and solidarity,\u201d a principle that served as a constant guide in Gernsheim\u2019s musical and personal life.\n\n\n== Selected works  (excerpted from worklist) ==\nOrchestral works\nSymphonies\nSymphony No. 1 in G minor, Op. 32, 1875\nSymphony No. 2 in E\u266d major, Op. 46, 1882\nSymphony No. 3 in C minor ('Miriam' or 'Mirjam'), Op. 54, 1887\nSymphony No. 4 in B\u266d major, Op. 62, 1895\nEarly Symphony in E\u266d major (completed 1857, Paris. 291 pp. manuscript.)\nKinder-Sinfonie : for strings, piano and children's instruments (1851)\nPiano concertos\nPiano Concerto in C minor, Op. 16\nViolin concertos\nViolin Concerto No. 1 in D major, Op. 42\nViolin Concerto No. 2 in F, Op. 86\nFantasy Piece for violin with orchestra, Op. 33\nCello concertos\nCello Concerto in E minor, Op. 78 (fairly popular in the early 20th century with many mentions in the Neue Zeitschrift as evidence, and played on SWR2 radio on January 31, 2005 by cellist Alexander H\u00fclshoff, the Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz, directed by Ari Rasilainen.

It consisted of labor, teacher, and student representatives as well as magistrates of the Superior District Court of La Paz. The President of the Junta was Superior District Court President Tom\u00e1s Monje who was appointed following the violent overthrow of President Gualberto Villarroel on 21 July 1946. As Monje was ill at the time of Villarroel's death, N\u00e9stor Guill\u00e9n, the Dean of the Superior District Court, took charge for the first 27 days before delegating command to Monje on 17 August 1946. As President of the Junta, Monje acted as a neutral figure heading the transition back to civilian government. The junta was dissolved on 10 March 1947 when Enrique Hertzog, winner of the January general election, took office as president.\n\n\n== Formation ==\n\n\n=== 1946 coup d'\u00e9tat ===\nOn 21 July 1946, weeks of increasingly violent protests and strikes led by teachers and students of the Higher University of San Andr\u00e9s (UMSA) resulted in full-scale riots in La Paz. President Gualberto Villarroel of the RADEPA military lodge was lynched and hanged as his government collapsed entirely. Members of the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement took refuge in foreign embassies or fled the country as conservative forces, sidelined since Villarroel's assumption to power in 1943, reasserted themselves within the country.\n\n\n=== Junta under Guill\u00e9n ===\n\nA general state of anarchy coupled with a crisis of succession followed the death and hanging of President Villarroel. Once the rioting died down, it was decided that provisional command of the government would be delegated to the Superior Court of Justice of the judicial district of La Paz whose magistrates were to head an interim junta presided over by Superior District Court President Tom\u00e1s Monje. As Monje was ill and hence unable to assume leadership at the time, Superior District Court Dean N\u00e9stor Guill\u00e9n was chosen to chair the junta in an interim capacity. Guill\u00e9n was joined by five other court judges: Cleto Cabrera Garc\u00eda, Juan Armaza Ribert, Carlos Pacheco N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Pac\u00edfico Ledezma, and Daniel Guisbert.On 22 July, participation in the junta was expanded to other sectors and the number of members was reduced. All district court judges except Guill\u00e9n and Cabrera Garc\u00eda stepped down while Carlos Monta\u00f1o Daza and Ra\u00fal Calvimontes joined, the latter as secretary-general. Immediately on 23 July, the junta published an eleven-point statement of intent. Among the first points was the commitment to respect domestic civil liberties as well as international agreements with other countries. The junta also pledged to call fresh, democratic presidential and legislative elections within three to four months. Having deemed the confiscation of newspapers by the previous government unconstitutional, the junta announced its intent to return these to their owners. By that point, the process had already begun with the newspaper La Raz\u00f3n having been returned to its publisher on 21 July. El Diaro became the first newspaper to return to daily circulation on 22 July. Further, all government offices were officially reopened at 2 p.m. on 23 July.That same day, at the direct order of Guill\u00e9n, UMSA Rector H\u00e9ctor Ormachea met with United States Ambassador Joseph Flack. Ormachea outlined the junta's intent to issue three decrees which would define the new government as one of \"

He worked his way up to upper-merchant in Makassar by 1712. Between June and September 1712 he was asked to be interim Governor of Makassar, following the death of Gerrit van Toll and until the arrival of his successor Joannes Sipman. He returned to Batavia in August 1714 as upper-merchant. In November of that year he was sent to Ceylon to become commander of Galle. In September 1716 he became commander of Malabar, in which position he generally had a good relationship with the Zamorin of Calicut. He was appointed Governor of Ceylon at the death of Isaak Augustyn Rumpf in June 1723. Jacob de Jong became commander of Malabar and Hertenberg took office in Colombo on 12 January 1724.  He seemed to have good relations with the local ruler, the King of Kandy, but died within two years in office on 19 October 1725.\n\n\n== References =="
"Fusiform_face_area| Visual system| Temporal lobe| ","The fusiform face area (FFA, meaning spindle-shaped face area) is a part of the human visual system (while also activated in people blind from birth) that is specialized for facial recognition. It is located in the inferior temporal cortex (IT), in the fusiform gyrus (Brodmann area 37).\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe FFA is located in the ventral stream on the ventral surface of the temporal lobe on the lateral side of the fusiform gyrus.  It is lateral to the parahippocampal place area. It displays some lateralization, usually being larger in the right hemisphere.\nThe FFA was discovered and continues to be investigated in humans using positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Usually, a participant views images of faces, objects, places, bodies, scrambled faces, scrambled objects, scrambled places, and scrambled bodies. This is called a functional localizer. Comparing the neural response between faces and scrambled faces will reveal areas that are face-responsive, while comparing cortical activation between faces and objects will reveal areas that are face-selective.\n\n\n== Function ==\nThe human FFA was first described by Justine Sergent in 1992 and later named by Nancy Kanwisher in 1997 who proposed that the existence of the FFA is evidence for domain specificity in the visual system. Studies have recently shown that the FFA is composed of functional clusters that are at a finer spatial scale than prior investigations have measured. Electrical stimulation of these functional clusters selectively distorts face perception, which is causal support for the role of these functional clusters in perceiving the facial image. While it is generally agreed that the FFA responds more to faces than to most other categories, there is debate about whether the FFA is uniquely dedicated to face processing, as proposed by Nancy Kanwisher and others, or whether it participates in the processing of other objects. The expertise hypothesis, as championed by Isabel Gauthier and others, offers an explanation for how the FFA becomes selective for faces in most people. The expertise hypothesis suggests that the FFA is a critical part of a network that is important for individuating objects that are visually similar because they share a common configuration of parts. Gauthier et al., in an adversarial collaboration with Kanwisher, tested both car and bird experts, and found some activation in the FFA when car experts were identifying cars and when bird experts were identifying birds. This finding has been replicated, and expertise effects in the FFA have been found for other categories such as chess displays and x-rays. Recently, it was found that the  thickness of the cortex in the FFA predicts the ability to recognize faces as well as vehicles.A 2009 magnetoencephalography study found that objects incidentally perceived as faces, an example of pareidolia, evoke an early (165-millisecond) activation in the FFA, at a time and location similar to that evoked by faces, whereas other common objects do not evoke such activation. This activation is similar to a face-specific ERP component N170. The authors suggest that face perception evoked by face-like objects is a relatively early process, and not a late cognitive reinterpretation phenomenon.One case study of agnosia provided evidence that faces are processed in a special way. A patient known as C. K., who suffered brain damage as a result of a car accident, later developed object agnosia. He experienced great difficulty with basic-level object recognition, also extending to body parts, but performed very well at recognizing faces. A later study showed that C. K. was unable to recognize faces that were inverted or otherwise distorted, even in cases where they could easily be identified by normal subjects. This is taken as evidence that the fusiform face area is specialized for processing faces in a normal orientation.\nStudies using functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrocorticography have demonstrated that activity in the FFA codes for individual faces and the FFA is tuned for behaviorally relevant facial features. An electrocorticography study found that the FFA is involved in multiple stages of face processing, continuously from when people see a face until they respond to it, demonstrating the dynamic and important role the FFA plays as part of the face perception network.Another study found that there is stronger activity in the FFA when a person sees a familiar face as opposed to an unfamiliar one. Participants were shown different pictures of faces that either had the same identity, familiar, or faces with separate identities, or unfamiliar. It found that participants were more accurate at matching familiar faces than unfamiliar ones. Using an fMRI, they also found that the participants that were more accurate in identifying familiar faces had more activity in their right fusiform face area and participants that were poor at matching had less activity in their right fusiform area.Surprisingly, in 2020, scientists showed the area is also activated in people born blind.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Function and controversy ===\nThe fusiform face area (FFA) is a part of the brain located in the fusiform gyrus with a debated purpose. Some researchers believe that the FFA is evolutionary purposed for face perception. Others believe that the FFA discriminates between any familiar stimuli.\nPsychologists debate whether the FFA is activated by faces for an evolutionary or expertise reason. The conflicting hypotheses stem from the ambiguity in FFA activation, as the FFA is activated by both familiar objects and faces. A study regarding novel objects called greebles determined this phenomenon. When first exposed to greebles, a person's FFA was activated more strongly by faces than by greebles. After familiarising themselves with individual greebles or becoming a greeble expert, a person's FFA was activated equally by faces and greebles. Likewise, children with autism have been shown to develop object recognition at a similarly impaired pace as face recognition. Studies of late patients of autism have discovered that autistic people have lower neuron densities in the FFA. This raises an interesting question, however: Is the poor face perception due to a reduced number of cells or is there a reduced number of cells because autistic people seldom perceive faces? Asked simply: Are faces simply objects with which every person has expertise?\n\n There is evidence supporting the FFA's evolutionary face-perception. Case studies into other dedicated areas of the brain may suggest that the FFA is intrinsically designed to recognize faces. Other studies have recognized areas of the brain essential to recognizing environments and bodies. Without these dedicated areas, people are incapable of recognizing places and bodies. Similar research regarding prosopagnosia has determined that the FFA is essential to the recognition of unique faces. However, these patients are capable of recognizing the same people normally by other means, such as voice. Studies involving language characters have also been conducted in order to ascertain the role of the FFA in face recognition. These studies have found that objects, such as Chinese characters, elicit a high response in different areas of the FFA than those areas that elicit a high response from faces. This data implies that certain areas of the FFA have evolutionary face-perception purposes.\n\n\n=== Evidence from infants ===\nThe FFA is underdeveloped in children and does not fully develop until adolescence. This calls into question the evolutionary purpose of the FFA, as children show the ability to differentiate faces. Three-day-old babies have been shown to prefer the face of their mother. Babies as early as three months old have shown the ability to distinguish between faces. During this time, babies may exhibit the ability to differentiate between genders, with some evidence suggesting that they prefer faces of the same sex as their primary caregiver. It is theorized that, in terms of evolution, babies focus on women for food, although the preference could simply reflect a bias for the caregivers they experience. Infants do not appear to use this area for the perception of faces. Recent fMRI work has found no face selective area in the brain of infants 4 to 6 months old. However, given that the adult human brain has been studied far more extensively than the infant brain, and that infants are still undergoing major neurodevelopmental processes, it may simply be that the FFA is not located in an anatomically familiar area. It may also be that activation for many different percepts and cognitive tasks in infants is diffuse in terms of neural circuitry, as infants are still undergoing periods of neurogenesis and neural pruning; this may make it more difficult to distinguish the signal, or what we would imagine as visual and complex familiar objects (like faces), from the noise, including static firing rates of neurons, and activity that is dedicated to a different task entirely than the activity of face processing.  Infant vision involves only light and dark recognition, recognizing only major features of the face, activating the amygdala. These findings question the evolutionary purpose of the FFA.\n\n\n=== Evidence from emotions ===\nStudies into what else may trigger the FFA validates arguments about its evolutionary purpose. There are countless facial expressions humans use that disturb the structure of the face. These disruptions and emotions are first processed in the amygdala and later transmitted to the FFA for facial recognition. This data is then used by the FFA to determine more static information about the face. The fact that the FFA is so far downstream in the processing of emotion suggests that it has little to do with emotion perception and instead deals in face perception.\nRecent evidence, however, shows that the FFA has other functions regarding emotion. The FFA is differentially activated by faces exhibiting different emotions. A study has determined that the FFA is activated more strongly by fearful faces than neutral faces. This implies that the FFA has functions in processing emotion despite its downstream processing and questions its evolutionary purpose to identify faces.\n\n\n== Additional images ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nNeural processing for individual categories of objects\nSuper recognisers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMcKone et al., Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 2007\nCarlson, Neil R., Physiology of Behavior, 9th ed., 2007.

"Ottapalam| Ottapalam| ","Ottapalam, (also spelled Ottappalam) is a town in Ottapalam taluk of the Palakkad district in Kerala, India. Chinakathoor Pooram, an event held every year at Chinakkathoor Temple in Palappuram near Ottapalam, is one of the famous festivals in Kerala.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area now known as Ottapalam was formerly known as Ayirur Thekkummuri Desam. The present-day Ottapalam, Pattambi and Cherpulassery areas were part of the medieval Nedunganad kingdom. Nedunganathiripad (Nedungadi) was the main ruler of Nedunganad. The headquarters was at Makovilakam near Kodikunnu, Chembulangad. Nedunaganad was ruled by the Nairs of Kavalappara, Thrikkadeeri, Kannambra, Vattakkavil Perumbada under the leadership of Nedunganathiripad. Ottappalam was the administrative area of Thrikkadeeri Nair. Its north side starts at Ayirur-Vadakkummuri near Mannarkkad and ends at Ayirur-Thekkummuri. After passing Ayirur-Thekkummuri, crossing the 'Ottapalam of Kanniyampuram river', then it comes the place to pay a toll for Kavalappara Nair.\nAround 1487 AD, the region was annexed to the kingdom of the Zamorin of Calicut. The Zamorin appointed his chieftain at Kavalappara Kovilakam. After the long rule by the Zamorin of Calicut, it became a part of the Kingdom of Mysore around 1766. It came under the rule of East India Company with the Treaty of Seringapatam in 1792. The British formed the Malabar District and built their headquarters at Kozhikode. The headquarters of North Malabar was at Thalassery and that of South Malabar was at Cherpulassery. The headquarters of South Malabar was later changed to Ottapalam. Ottapalam was a part of Walluvanad Taluk of Malappuram Revenue Division in Malabar District with its Taluk headquarters at Perinthalmanna during British Raj. The railway came and the place was renamed as Ottappalam. The South Malabar Special Court started functioning at Ottappalam by 1880. Thus the name Ottappalam became familiar. Gradually, the name Ayirur-Thekkummuri was confined to the land records.\nBefore the Indian Independence, present-day Kerala state was scattered in South Canara and Malabar Districts of British India and two princely states namely Cochin and Travancore. The first All-Kerala conference of Indian National Congress was held in 1921 at Ottapalam, which was the then capital of South Malabar, on the bank of the river Bharathappuzha, which also later demanded a separate state for the Malayalam-speaking regions in future Independent India. Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee was formed in that conference. Before that, Malabar District, Cochin, and Travancore had separate Congress committees. Ottapalam is located right in the middle of Kerala state.\nOttapalam is also called The New Film City of Kerala.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nOttapalam is located at 10.77\u00b0N 76.38\u00b0E\ufeff / 10.77; 76.38. It has an average elevation of 54 m (177 ft).\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nOttapalam is sub district of the Palakkad District. Over the last 10 years, the population growth has been 9.2%. The town is listed in the top 18 most populous Urban Agglomeration in Kerala. The First Defence Park in India is established in Ottapalam KINFRA industrial park. A film district is also under discussion.\n\nThe Ottapalam assembly constituency is part of Palakkad Lok Sabha constituency.\nHindus make up 67.44%\nFollowed by Muslims at 29.68%\n\n\n=== Ottapalam Taluk ===\nOttapalam is one of the six Taluks of Palakkad district.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe Palakkad-Shoranur (Kulappully) State Highway passes through the town. Government buses as well as private bus services operate between Ottapalam and other major towns, such as Thrissur, Palakkad, Mannarkkad, Perinthalmanna, Pattambi, Guruvayoor, Thiruvilwamala, Chelakkara (through the Ottapalam-Mayanur Bridge, inaugurated on 22 January 2011.)\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThe town is served by the Ottapalam railway station, which lies between Palakkad and Shoranur Junction on the Jolarpettai\u2013Shoranur line.

One creation is extant as of 2013. The Blackett family can be traced back to the Blacketts/Blakheveds of Woodcroft, County Durham, some of whom became highly successful in the lead and coal mining industries in Northumberland and County Durham.\nThe Blackett Baronetcy, of Newcastle in the County of Northumberland, was created in the Baronetage of England on 12 December 1673 for William Blackett, Member of Parliament for Newcastle-upon-Tyne.   Blackett was succeeded by his elder son, Edward, the second Baronet who represented Ripon and Northumberland in the House of Commons and built Newby Hall. William's third younger son William was created a baronet in his own right in 1685 (see below). The second Baronet's eldest surviving son, Edward, the third Baronet, was a captain in the Royal Navy. He died childless in 1756 and was succeeded by his nephew, Edward, the fourth Baronet, who was Member of Parliament for Northumberland and the son of John Blackett. The title thereafter descended from father to son until the death of Charles, the ninth Baronet, in 1968. Two of his younger brothers, George, the tenth Baronet, and Francis, the eleventh Baronet, both succeeded in the title. As of 2013 the title is held by the latter's eldest son, Hugh, the twelfth Baronet, who succeeded in 1995. Another member of the family to gain distinction was Henry Blackett (1867\u20131952), son of John Charles Blackett, fourth son of the fourth Baronet. He was an Admiral in the Royal Navy.\nThe family seat was Matfen Hall, Matfen, Northumberland, now a hotel and country club. It is now the nearby Halton Castle, Northumberland.\nThe Blackett Baronetcy, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the County of Northumberland, was created in the Baronetage of England on 23 January 1685 for William Blackett, third son of the first Baronet of the 1673 creation. He sat as Member of Parliament for Newcastle-upon-Tyne. On his death the title passed to his son, William, the second Baronet. He also represented Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the House of Commons.

"Tozzia| Tozzia| Orobanchaceae genera| Plants described in 1753| Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus| Monotypic Lamiales genera| Parasitic plants| ","Tozzia is a monotypic genus of flowering plants within the broomrape family Orobanchaceae. It contains a unique species, Tozzia alpina.\nWhile the plant in its young, vegetative stage is holoparasite, it becomes hemiparasite in its flowering stage. The originality of this species is therefore to combine half and full parasitism.The range of Tozzia alpina extends from the Pyrenees and the Alps to the Balkans and the Carpathians.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Vegetative features ===\nTozzia alpina is a herbaceous, perennial plant, reaching heights of 10 to 50 centimetres (3.9 to 19.7 in). The quadrangular stem is hairless in the lower part, hairy on the edges in the middle and upper part. The simple, bright green leaves are broad, ovate, serrate, with a length of 1 to 3.5 centimeters, a rounded or slightly heart-shaped basis, and a sharp upper end.\n\n\n=== Reproductive features ===\n\nThe flowering period is from June to August. The hermaphroditic zygomorph flowers are organized into a raceme inflorescence. The bracts have a 3 to 10 millimeters long, thin, one-sided hairy stalk. The fruit is spherical with a diameter of 2 to 2.5 millimeters. The seeds are almost spherical, smooth and white with a round black spot.\n\n\n== Systematics ==\nThe genus name Tozzia was given in 1729 by Pier Antonio Micheli. It is a taxonomic patronym in honor of Bruno Tozzi, a monk and later abbot of the monastery Vallombrosa at Reggello in Tuscany, who published in 1703 a work about Tuscan plant species.\nThe first description of the species Tozzia alpina was made in 1753 by Carl von Linn\u00e9.\nTwo subspecies have been described:\nTozzia alpina L. subsp. alpina, occurring in Spain, France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Italy, and former Yugoslavia ;\nTozzia alpina subsp. carpathica (Wol\u0142.) Pawl\u0142. (Syn: Tozzia carpathica Wol\u0142.), occurring in Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Ukraine.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nThe phylogeny of the genera of Rhinantheae has been explored using molecular characters. Tozzia belongs to the core Rhinantheae. Tozzia is closely related to Odontites, Bellardia, and Hedbergia. In turn, these genera share phylogenetic affinities with Euphrasia, and then with Bartsia.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nTozzia alpina is a geophyte. In the first year of its growth, Tozzia feeds as holoparasite on large-leaved herbaceous plants, such as species of the genera Rumex, Adenostyles and Petasites. As of the second year, it becomes a hemiparasite with its own assimilation, but still receives nutrients from the host plant.\nIt thrives at altitudes of 800 to 2600 meters. In the Allg\u00e4u Alps it rises at the Linkerskopf in Bavaria up to an altitude of 2200 meters. It also prefers lime-rich and nutrient-rich, wet-fresh to moist clay soils, with northern exposures.\n\n\n== References =="
"Premenstrual_dysphoric_disorder| Gynaecologic disorders| ","Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a mood disorder characterized by emotional, cognitive, and physical symptoms that cause significant distress or impairment in menstruating women during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The symptoms occur in the luteal phase, (between ovulation and menses), improve within a few days after the onset of menses, and are minimal or absent in the week after menses. PMDD has a profound impact on a person's quality of life and dramatically increases the risk of suicidal ideation and even suicide attempts.  Many females of reproductive age experience discomfort or mild mood changes prior to menstruation. However, 5-8% experience severe premenstrual syndrome causing significant distress or functional impairment. Within this population of reproductive age, some women will meet the criteria for PMDD. PMDD is most common from age 25-35, but can occur anytime during a woman's reproductive years.The exact cause of PMDD is currently unknown. However, because the symptoms are only present during ovulatory cycles and resolve after menses, it is believed to be caused by fluctuations in gonadal sex hormones or variations in sensitivity to sex hormones.In 2017, researchers at the National Institutes of Health discovered that women with PMDD have genetic changes that make their emotional regulatory pathways more sensitive to estrogen and progesterone, as well as their chemical derivatives. The researchers believe that this increased sensitivity may be responsible for PMDD symptoms.Some studies have suggested that those with PMDD are more at risk of developing postpartum depression after pregnancy, but other evidence has been found to suggest against that notion. PMDD was added to the list of depressive disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 2013. It has 11 main symptoms, and a woman has to exhibit at least five to be diagnosed with PMDD. Roughly 20% of women have some symptoms of PMDD, but either have less than five or do not have functional impairment.First line treatment for PMDD is with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Hormonal therapy with oral contraceptives that contain drospirenone have demonstrated efficiency in reducing PMDD symptoms as well. Cognitive behavioral therapy, whether in combination with SSRIs or alone, has shown to be effective in reducing impairment.  Dietary modifications and exercise may also be helpful, but studies investigating these treatments have not demonstrated efficacy in reducing PMDD symptoms.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nClinicians consider mood symptoms, physical symptoms and impact on the patient's life in making the diagnosis of PMDD. Mood symptoms include emotional liability (rapidly changing emotions, sensitivity to rejection, etc.), irritability and anger that may lead to conflict, anxiety, feeling on edge, hopelessness, difficulty concentrating, appetite changes, sleeping more or less than usual, or feeling out of control. The physical symptoms are similar to the symptoms of PMS. These include breast tenderness or swelling, joint pain, muscle pain, gaining weight, or feeling bloated.Because of the broad variety in clinical presentation, the onset of symptoms only during or around the luteal phase is key for diagnosing someone with PMDD rather than any other mood disorders. PMDD follows a predictable, cyclic pattern. Symptoms begin in the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (after ovulation) and end or are markedly reduced shortly after menstruation begins. On average, the symptoms last six days but can start up to two weeks before menses, meaning symptoms can be felt for up to three weeks out of a cycle. Severe symptoms can begin and worsen until the onset of menstruation, with many not feeling relief until a few days after menstruation ends. The most intense symptoms occurring in the week and days leading up to the first day of menstrual blood flow. The symptoms usually cease shortly after the start of the menstrual period or a few days after it ends. Various symptom and severity tracking questionnaires exist to document presence and severity of symptoms throughout consecutive menstrual cycles.The International Society for the Study of Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD) defines two categories of premenstrual disorders: core PMD and variant PMD.\nCore PMD has six characteristics, all mainly focusing on the cyclical nature of PMDD and its typical onset pre-menses tracked over the course of more than two menstrual cycles. The four classified Variant PMDs involve more unexpected variables that cause the onset of premenstrual distress; such as, PMD with absent menstruation or premenstrual exacerbation, wherein the symptoms of another preexisting psychological disorder may be heightened as a result of PMDD onset.\n\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nAbout 5-8% of women of reproductive age suffer from severe premenstrual syndrome; most of these women also meet criteria for PMDD. PMDD is most common from age 25-35, but can occur anytime during a woman's reproductive years.Among females of reproductive age living in India, the prevalence of PMDD is 8%.\n\n\n== Pathophysiology ==\nPMDD mood symptoms are only present in menstruating women. Thus, symptoms do not occur during pregnancy, after menopause, or in women who have anovulatory cycles. Other mood disorders typically persist across all reproductive life events and are independent of a woman's menstrual cycle.The current consensus on the cause of PMDD is a combination of heightened sensitivity to fluctuating levels of certain hormones (i.e. the reproductive hormones), environmental stress, and genetic predisposition. The sex steroids\u2014estrogen and progesterone\u2014are neuroactive; they have been noted in rat models to be involved in serotonin pathways. Serotonin is involved in mood regulation alongside estrogen, whose receptors are found in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus\u2014the regions most known for their involvement in regulating one's mood and cognition overall.While the timing of symptoms suggests hormonal fluctuations as the cause of PMDD, a demonstrable hormonal imbalance in women with PMDD has not been identified. In fact, levels of reproductive hormones and their metabolites in women with and without PMDD are indistinguishable. It is instead hypothesized that women with PMDD are more sensitive to normal levels of hormone fluctuations, predominantly estrogen and progesterone, which produces biochemical events in the nervous system that cause the premenstrual symptoms. These symptoms are more predominant in women who have a predisposition to the disorder.It is apparent that the premenstrual disorders are biologically driven and are not only psychological or cultural phenomena. PMDD has been reported by menstruating women worldwide, indicating a biological basis that is not geographically selective. Most psychologists infer that this disorder is caused by both a reaction to hormone flux and also genetic components. There is evidence of heritability of (retrospectively-reported) premenstrual symptoms from several twin and family studies done in the 1990s, with the heritability of PMDD proving to be about 56%.\n\n\n=== Genetic factors ===\nWhile whether or not this disorder has a specific genetic basis is still being discussed in the academic community and the possible genetic factors contributing to PMDD have yet to be thoroughly researched, there has recently been multiple genetic factors identified that contribute to the moodiness, depression, irritability, increased appetite, trouble sleeping, acne, fluid retention, headaches, nausea, and other symptoms that are all associated with this disorder.\nMany studies have noted that a polymorphism of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF), a gene that helps support neurons in their function and survival in the brain by creating a protein that helps in the growth, maturation, and maintenance of these cells, may play a role in causing PMDD symptoms. This is because the result of this polymorphism mimics the hallmarks of PMDD: volatile moods, depression and irritability centered around the menstrual cycle. This gene has been studied extensively in its association with depression and, promisingly for PMDD research, mice homozygous for the BDNF polymorphism exhibited anxiety-like traits that fluctuated and changed around the mice\u2019s estrus, analogous to the human\u2019s menstruation, therefore mimicking some of the symptoms of PMDD.\n\n\n=== Risk Factors ===\nEnvironmental stressors have also been found to prospectively increase risk for PMDD symptoms. Environmental components such as stress, hormonal fluctuation, and epigenetics play a key role in the pathology and onset of the disorder. Some studies have noted evidence of interpersonal trauma (domestic violence, physical or emotional trauma, or substance abuse) or seasonal changes (making PMDD potentially comorbid with Seasonal Affective Disorder) having an impact on PMDD risk. But the most common pre-existing disorder found in those diagnosed with PMDD is major depression, wherein they either actually had it or were misdiagnosed when they should have only been diagnosed with PMDD. Finally, an easily modifiable risk factor for PMDD is cigarette smoking. One meta-analysis found dramatically increased risk of developing PMDD in menstruating women who smoke.\n\n\n=== Relationship to pregnancy and menopause ===\nWomen with PMDD usually see their symptoms disappear while they are pregnant. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is primarily a mood disorder that is associated with onset of menstruation; pregnancy, menopause, and hysterectomies all cause menstruation to cease, thereby stopping the proposed sex steroid-/serotonin-caused symptoms from occurring. Although one might expect a higher rate of postpartum depression among those with PMDD, a large study of women with prospectively-confirmed PMDD did not find a higher prevalence of postpartum depression than in controls. If a woman had experienced PPD beforehand, there was found to be a less-than 12% chance of PMDD pathology emerging\u2014hardly any differentiation from the regular population of those who have never experienced postpartum depression. However, PMDD symptoms can get worse following pregnancy, or other associated events such as birth and miscarriage.\n\n\n=== Mental Health Comorbidities in PMDD ===\nThe lifetime incidence of other psychiatric disorders is high among women with PMDD. An older review article (2002) utilizing the previous edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) used studies from 1966 to 2002 on PMS and mental health disorders and selected for patients who retrospectively met the diagnostic criteria for PMDD and found that Major Depressive Disorder, Seasonal affective disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder often co-occur in PMDD. Another systematic review study suggests that patients with bipolar disorder, type I or II, have a higher incidence of PMDD. While the diagnosis of PMDD requires a mental health provider to determine that the symptoms a woman is facing is not due to an underlying mental or physical health condition, it is important to note that other conditions often co-occur and impact the quality of life and treatment plan for people with PMDD.\n\n\n=== Suicidality in Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder ===\nPrevious links to suicidality and PMS have been made, but women with PMDD are more likely still to consider and attempt suicide even when controlling for mental health comorbidities. Despite the increase in suicidal ideation and attempts in this population, the data currently suggests that suicidal ideation or action is not more likely to occur during the late luteal phase when PMDD symptoms would occur. It is difficult to study whether treatment reduces suicidality because of the multifaceted reasons provided for suicidal ideation. However, treatment has been well documented to reduce physical and emotional symptoms of PMDD.\n\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nDiagnostic criteria for PMDD are provided by a number of expert medical guides. Diagnosis can be supported by having women who are seeking treatment for PMDD use a daily charting method to record their symptoms. Daily charting helps to distinguish when mood disturbances are experienced and allows PMDD to be more easily distinguished from other mood disorders. With PMDD, mood symptoms are present only during the luteal phase, or last two weeks, of the menstrual cycle. While PMDD mood symptoms are of a cyclical nature, other mood disorders are variable or constant over time. Although there is a lack of consensus on the most efficient instrument by which to confirm a PMDD diagnosis, several validated scales for recording premenstrual symptoms include the Calendar of Premenstrual Experiences (COPE), Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP), and Prospective Record of the Severity of Menstruation (PRISM). In the context of research, standardized numerical cutoffs are often applied to verify the diagnosis. The difficulty of diagnosing PMDD is one reason that it can be challenging for lawyers to cite the disorder as a defense of crime, in the very rare cases where PMDD is allegedly associated with criminal violence.\n\n\n=== DSM-5 ===\nThe DSM-5 which established seven criteria (A through G) for the diagnosis of PMDD which is paraphrased below. There is overlap between the criteria for PMDD in the DSM-5 and the criteria found in the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP).According to the DSM-5, a diagnosis of PMDD requires the presence of at least five of these symptoms with one of the symptoms being numbers 1-4. These symptoms should occur during the week before menses and remit after initiation of menses. In order to meet criteria for the diagnosis, the symptoms should be charted prospectively for two consecutive ovulation cycles in order to confirm a temporal and cyclical nature of the symptoms. The symptoms should also be severe enough to affect normal work, school, social activities, and/or relationships with others.\nThe symptoms of Criteria A-C must have been met for most menstrual cycles that occurred in the preceding year, and have to have cause significant impairment in family, work, school, or social functioning. (Criterion D).\nTiming\nCriterion A: During most menstrual cycles throughout the past year, at least 5 of the symptoms outlined in Criterion B and Criterion C must be present in the final week before the onset of menses, must start to improve within a few days after the onset of menses, and become minimal or absent in the week post-menses.\nSymptoms\nCriterion B: One (or more) of the following symptoms must be present:\n\nMarked affective lability (e.g., mood swings, feeling suddenly sad or tearful, or increased sensitivity to rejection)\nMarked irritability or anger or increased interpersonal conflicts\nMarked depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts\nMarked anxiety, tension, and/or feelings of being keyed up or on edgeCriterion C: One (or more) of the following symptoms must be present additionally, to reach a total of 5 symptoms when combined with present symptoms from Criterion B above:\nDecreased interest in usual activities (e.g., work, school, friends, hobbies).\nSubjective difficulty in concentration.\nLethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy.\nMarked change in appetite; overeating; or specific food cravings.\nHypersomnia or insomnia.\nA sense of being overwhelmed or out of control.\nPhysical symptoms such as breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, a sensation of \"

"Bereavement_flight| Airline tickets| Grief| ","In the United States and Canada, a bereavement flight is a flight purchased when a close relative has died or is dying. Bereavement fares used to be offered by many airlines, but as of 2015, most have stopped providing them.Bereavement flights often have flexible rules, and sometimes a reduced rate, however, the price of the fare depends on the airline. Customers may be able to obtain a bereavement fare for last-minute flights that is comparable to that of a regular fare purchased in advance.Until the late 1990s, it was common for an airline to waive the 7- or 14-day advance purchase rule for bereavements, but in recent years, many airlines have been cutting back on bereavement fares. Instead, many short-notice travelers rely on hidden city fares or other airline booking ploys.\n\n\n== Policies of various airlines ==\nAirlines have varying policies pertaining to bereavement flights. This may include the relatives for which one is eligible to obtain such a ticket, the proof that is required, and the price that is charged in comparison with other fares.\nUnited Airlines no longer offers bereavement fares, but still has more flexible options for changing and canceling flights. Formerly, they offered bereavement fares of 5% off the ticket price in the event of the death or grave illness of a family member or for individuals seeking medical treatment for tickets sold within six days of travel.\nDelta Air Lines allows discounts for death or imminent death for those who call in advance for reservations.\nAir Canada offers bereavement fares within 7 days of a funeral and for stays of up to 30 days with a copy of a death certificate, a letter from a funeral director, or a certificate from an attending physician. For international itineraries only, the airline will also refund the difference between the regular and the bereavement fare if one of these is presented after travel.\nAmerican Airlines no longer offers a compassion fare for customers traveling due to a medical emergency or death of a family member after the merger with US Airways.\nAlaska Airlines offers a bereavement fare for those traveling due to the death of an immediate family member.

"Rally_America| Rally America| Recurring sporting events established in 2005| Rally racing series| ","The Rally America National Championship was the national championship of rallying events in the United States. The inaugural season was in 2005. Rally America was also the name given to the organization that sanctioned the championship, was briefly rebranded to RallyCar in July 2010, then reverted to Rally America the following year. 2018 was the final year that Rally America sanctioned a rally event. In 2019 Rally America briefly became a media organization with the stated goal of promoting rally in the United States before pausing all social media posts and shutting down its official website.\n\n\n== History ==\nRally America was founded in 2002 by CPD Rally Team owner Doug Havir, who provided scoring and reporting services to the Sports Car Club of America's ProRally Championship.  The two companies worked in tandem until the end of the 2004 season, when the SCCA withdrew its involvement in U.S. stage rallying.  The SCCA then made the decision to sell all commercial and sanctioning rights to Rally America.\nIn 2005, the inaugural Rally America National Championship was run, incorporating most of the events previously sanctioned by the SCCA. In 2011, Vermont businessman Bill Fogg took over ownership of Rally America from Havir.\n\n\n=== Rallies previously associated with Rally America ===\n\n\n== Champions ==\n\n\n== Event winners ==\n\n\n== Points ==\nThe points are awarded based on final position, as well as achieving a point for starting the race and one point for finishing the race. Thus, finishing a race will automatically earn the driver three points: one for starting, one for finishing, and one for coming in 10th+ place. \n\n\n== Manufacturers ==\nRally America did not maintain manufacturer scoring or provide recognition for vehicle successes.  Most cars are selected by their drivers or teams with the vast majority being entered without any special involvement by their manufacturers.\n\n\n=== Subaru ===\nSubaru was an integral part of Rally America from its inception. The Subaru WRX STi version of the Impreza vehicle, had already become the most numerous competitive rally car in North America.  Subaru became a sponsor of the series and many prizes and other incentives were provided by the company both for rally in general, and Subaru driving teams in particular.  A fully stocked parts truck was dispatched to all national events, offering Subaru teams unique access to parts and expertise on scene. There were discounts on parts for teams using Subaru Rally Team USA parts.\n\n\n=== Mitsubishi ===\nMitsubishi was Subaru's primary competitor in North America, with its Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution series of cars. In the hands of competitive drivers, the Evo proved a challenge to the larger quantity of WRXs, often edging into top three finishes.\n\n\n=== Ford ===\nFord Motor Company has had a long history in rallying item rallycross both World Rally Championship and in North America. Ford made a unique appearance in American rallying at the 2009 X Games. Driven by Tanner Foust, Ken Block and Brian Deegan, three open-class Ford Fiestas were dominant (two of the three claimed podium positions) throughout the weekend. Block, the eventual winner, praised the car, while Foust has said he would like to see a factory-backed Ford Racing team competing regularly in Rally America. For 2010, Ford announced that they would be sponsoring a Fiesta in Rally America and the X-Games.\n\n\n=== Volkswagen ===\nWhile not often contending for top overall spots they were good cars for those contesting the two-wheel-drive championships and for beginners. The Volkswagen Jetta, Volkswagen Golf and Volkswagen Beetle all had many appearances and much success in Rally America events.\n\n\n=== Scion ===\nThe Scion Rally xD debuted in the two-wheel-drive category at the 2010 Oregon Trail Rally with Christopher Duplessis at the wheel.  In 2011, Duplessis switched to a Ford, and the Scion xD was piloted by Andrew Comrie-Picard.\n\n\n== Groups ==\nIn 2009, Rally America narrowed down the number of championships.  The regional rallies have many categories split into two events, such as 2 Wheel Drive being split into a separate championship for Group 2 and Group 5, as well as the addition of an Open Light. A list of the full rules can be seen at the Rally America website.\n\n\n=== Open ===\nThe engine is turbo charged and must be based on a production engine with the power being limited by the use of an inlet restrictor. The body must be recognizable as the original car.  There is a minimum weight also enforced dependent on the engine.\n\n\n=== Open Lite ===\n2.5L or less naturally aspirated 4wd production vehicles with no minimum weight. Like the open class the body must be recognizable as the original car.\n\n\n=== Super Production ===\nThe chassis generation must match the appearance and modifications of the car. Thus, one can take a chassis from a 2006 Subaru WRX and put a 2003 WRX shell around it, but all parts must be allowable for a 2003 WRX.  Engine displacement cannot be more than 2.6 liter with multipliers, and a limiter is placed on any forced induction system. A minimum weight is also enforced.  Many other parts can be replaced, as long as they are an option from the manufacturer.\n\n\n=== 2 Wheel Drive ===\nThese are based on the old FIA Group 5 and Group 2 standards.  Both are limited on weight, displacement, and must be based on cars with a production of 1000 per year. Power may be sent to either the rear wheels or the front wheels.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRally America\nRally America Videos"

"Thomas_Swann_(attorney)| 1765 births| 1840 deaths| Virginia lawyers| Members of the Virginia House of Delegates| 19th-century American politicians| People from Leesburg, Virginia| Lawyers from Alexandria, Virginia| ","Thomas Swann (July 21, 1765 \u2013 February 2, 1840) was an America lawyer, businessman and politician who twice served in the Virginia House of Delegates and for more than a decade served as the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia.\n\n\n== Early and family life ==\nSwann was born in Prince George's County, Maryland to the former Nancy Ann Naylor and her husband, Edward Swann Jr. He had several brothers (some of whom fought in the American Revolutionary War and William T. Swann who would follow him to Alexandria) and sisters. He received a private education suitable for his class. In January 1789 he settled in Loudoun County and on April 2, 1795 married Jane Byrd Page (1774-1812), who was descended from the First Families of Virginia. Her father Mann Page of Gloucester County had died in 1779, when she was a child, but left her 2000 pounds if she reached adulthood, as well as a personal estate including many slaves. The new Swann family settled in Alexandria by the end of the year. Although three children died as infants and are buried (as is their mother) in the graveyard of Christ Church in Alexandria, theirs sons Wilson Cary Swann, Thomas Swann Jr., Edward Swann, John Swann, William Page Swann and Robert Page Swann and daughter Mary Swann survived their mother. W.C. Swann and Thomas Swann Jr. followed their father's path into politics, and the latter eventually became president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, then Baltimore's mayor before the American Civil War and Maryland's governor and a U.S. Congressman after the war.\nTheir mother's legacy, several children and interconnected family relationships led this man to file a deed in 1818 dividing property among their children, as well as considerable additional probate litigation in the 1830s. Although not listed in tax and census records for northern Virginia counties, the Swann household owned enslaved people, at least 40 when this Thomas Swann died in 1840.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe elder Thomas Swann studied law, was admitted to the Virginia bar, and practiced in northern Virginia and what became the new federal city, Washington, D.C. In 1794, Loudoun County voters elected him as one of their two (part-time) representatives in the Virginia House of Delegates, where he served alongside fellow Alexandria attorney Charles Lee. In 1795 Swann was appointed the prosecutor for the city of Alexandria, Virginia, and he became a city councilor in 1799 and again in 1801-1802, as well as for a final time after Alexandria became part of the District of Columbia in 1804-1805. Either as prosecutor or city councilor (or both), in 1805 he joined Edmund J. Lee and other attorneys in petitioning President Thomas Jefferson to grant an official pardon to a slave sentenced to death for committing a burlary in Alexandria.Swann again won election as delegate to the Virginia House of Delegates, this time representing Fairfax County in the 1799 session alongside Richard Bland Lee, then winning re-election and serving in the 1800 session alongside Nicholas Fitzhugh.Swann became involved in the business life of Alexandria and the new federal city across the Potomac River, as well as witnessed many real estate deeds throughout northern Virginia. In 1800, Swann became one of the directors of the Marine Insurance Company in Alexandria. In 1804, Swann published notice that he would file lawsuits against debtors owing the Mutual Assurance Society. Also in that year, Swann joined several fellow Alexandrians including fellow lawyers Charles Lee and Cuthbert Powell as well as prominent merchants Elisha Janney and William Hartshorne, among others, to form the Bank of Potomac. Four years later, in 1808, Swann joined again with Powell but now with Edmund J. Lee and others at Gadsby's Tavern to form the Alexandria Turnpike Company, in order to construct a road and bridge to Georgetown on the other side of the Potomac River. In 1810 Swann became one of the town's directors for the newly formed Farmers Bank in Alexandria, and in 1817 he became a director of the Franklin Bank in Alexandria. In 1817, the Alexandria court appointed Swann, Edmund J. Lee and Colin Auld as trustees of the failed Merchant's Bank, and in 1819 Swann became president of the Mechanics Bank of Alexandria during its reorganization.Meanwhile, in 1808 Swann bought a house and 262 acres in Loudoun County from Dr. Wilson Cary Selden, who had served as a surgeon during the Revolutionary War (and likely had become the namesake of Swann's first son two years earlier). Swann expanded the estate to 1400 acres and he and his son Thomas Swann Jr. operated it for decades. Swann continued to make Alexandria his primary residence for years following his wife's death, as he raised their four sons (two of whom died before 1825). In  1818, Swann was one of the Alexandrians who signed a petition for Alexandria to be retroceded from the District of Columbia and returned to Virginia, which did not happen until after his death.Swann became the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia in 1821, and remained such until 1833, when he sold the house he had built at the corner of Columbus and Prince Streets in Alexandria. Meanwhile, his most controversial venture into banking was his election as president of the Washington Branch of the Second Bank of the United States, contrary to the wishes of Nicholas Biddle, who had supported Roger C. Weightman for that position. Swann conducted an investigation about embezzlement by a Washington branch cashier named Smith. In 1828 (when former President Monroe's property in Albemarle County was sold to satisfy his debts to the bank) Biddle convinced the other directors to replace Swann with his preferred bank president, Samuel Harrison Smith, formerly Secretary of the Treasury, as well as President of the Bank of Washington between 1809 and 1819. In 1824 Swann bought at lot at the corner of Connecticut Avenue and H Street facing Lafayette Square and the White House in the federal city, and by 1829 built a three story house that after later extensive renovations became the home of the W.W. Corcoran family, and was ultimately demolished and replaced by the Chamber of Commerce building. However, the cost of that house, controversy between President Jackson and the Bank of the United States, and the Panic of 1837 led to financial difficulties for both Swann and his nemesis, Biddle, both of whom sold property to their sons in order to raise cash.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nSwann died in Loudoun County in 1840, and was buried at Morven Park or at St. James Episcopal Church. Morven Park remained in the family until 1898, and a few years later was acquired by future Virginia governor Westmoreland Davis, whose widow created a foundation to operate it as a historic site and museum. His sons Dr. Wilson C. Swann and Thomas Swann Jr. became prominent Unionists (in Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively) before and during the American Civil War. Morven Park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, and is also part of the Catoctin Rural Historic District. Swann's Alexandria House also continues to exist, again as a private residence, at 712 Prince Street and is a contributing property to its historic district.  Now known as the Swann-Daingerfield House (the latter being the insurance executive to whom Swann sold the house in 1833 and who added a ballroom and whose family lived in the house until 1899), its wings were added by the \"

It was a follow-up to the Chang'e 1 lunar probe, which was launched in 2007. Chang'e 2 was part of the first phase of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program, and conducted research from a 100-km-high lunar orbit in preparation for the December 2013 soft landing by the Chang'e 3 lander and rover. Chang'e 2 was similar in design to Chang'e 1, although it featured some technical improvements, including a more advanced onboard camera. Like its predecessor, the probe was named after Chang'e, an ancient Chinese moon goddess.\nAfter completing its primary objective, the probe left lunar orbit for the Earth\u2013Sun L2 Lagrangian point, to test the Chinese tracking and control network, making the China National Space Administration the third space agency after NASA and ESA to have visited this point. It entered orbit around L2 on 25 August 2011, and began transmitting data from its new position in September 2011. In April 2012, Chang'e 2 departed L2 to begin an extended mission to the asteroid 4179 Toutatis, which it successfully flew by in December 2012. This success made China's CNSA the fourth space agency to directly explore asteroids, after NASA, ESA and JAXA. As of 2014, Chang'e 2 has travelled over 100 million km from Earth, conducting a long-term mission to verify China's deep-space tracking and control systems. Contact with the spacecraft was lost in 2014 as its signal strength weakened due to distance. The probe is expected to return to Earth's vicinity sometime around 2027.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Chinese Lunar Exploration Program is designed to be conducted in four  phases of incremental technological advancement: The first is simply reaching lunar orbit, a task completed by Chang'e 1 in 2007 and Chang'e 2 in 2010. The second is landing and roving on the Moon, as Chang'e 3 did in 2013 and Chang'e 4 did in 2019. The third is collecting lunar samples from the near-side and sending them to Earth, a task Chang'e 5 completed in 2020 and Chang'e 6 will repeat. The fourth phase consists of development of a robotic research station near the Moon's south pole. The program aims to facilitate a crewed lunar landing in the 2030s and possibly build an outpost near the south pole.\n\n\n== Design ==\nChang'e 2 was the backup of the Chang'e 1 probe and it had been modified for its own mission. While Chang'e 1 operated in a 200-km orbit, Chang'e 2 flew at only 100 km, allowing for higher-resolution images and more precise science data. The probe also possessed a higher-resolution camera, being able to resolve features as small as 1 metre (3.3 ft) across from orbit. According to Qian Huang of the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and Yong-Chun Zheng of the NAOC, the spacecraft also had a shorter Earth-to-Moon cruise time of 5 days, rather than 12.  The probe's launch rocket had two more boosters to accomplish this more direct route to the Moon. Furthermore, its laser altimeter's footprint was smaller than Chang'e 1's, achieving 5-meter vertical accuracy in its estimate of the Moon's radius. It also pulsed more frequently \u2013 five times per second rather than just once per second, as Chang'e 1's altimeter did. Additionally, the probe's main camera had a spatial resolution of 10 metres (33 ft), rather than 120 metres (390 ft). The total cost of the Chang'e 2 mission was approximately CN\u00a5900 million ($125 million).Late in the mission, Chang'e 2's orbit was lowered to an elliptical one, with the same apolune (100 km) as Chang'e 1, but with a perilune of only 15 km. Tracking for the mission was performed with an X-band radio capability, which was not available for Chang'e 1. Zheng remarked that \"

The only road connection is Kreisstra\u00dfe 1, which leads down to Rheinbrohl over a length of eight kilometres into the Rhine Valley.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe village was first documented in 1280 as Rukenvelt. Until 1693 it belonged to G\u00f6nnersdorf (today part of Feldkirchen). In 1846 11 families lived in the village, from 1885 an official school was established, which was closed again in 1935.\nAt the end of World War II 50 people still lived in Rockenfeld. Due to constant emigration, the local council decided to dissolve the community in 1965. In 1969 the abandoned houses and courtyards were burned down by the fire brigade. In 1995 the last house was demolished. Today Rockenfeld is a deserted area with a memorial from 1962/63 and a memorial stone as the only remains.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRockenfeld at the website of Neuwied Municipality (in German)\nArticle, a Super 8 film and slides of Rockenfeld burnt down by the fire brigade (in German)"

"Healthcare_in_Kent| Health in Kent| Healthcare in England by county| ","Healthcare in Kent is now mainly the responsibility from 1 April 2020 of the Kent & Medway Clinical Commissioning Group. Certain specialised services are directly commissioned by NHS England, coordinated through the South East integrated regional team. Some NHS England structures are aligned on a Kent & Medway basis, others on a South East basis and there is liaison  with London that provides many tertiary (highly specialised) healthcare services to the residents of Kent.  \n\n\n== History ==\nFrom 1947 to 1965 NHS services in Kent were managed by the South-East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board.   In 1974 the boards were abolished and replaced by regional health authorities. The whole of Kent came under the South East Metropolitan RHA.  Regions were reorganised in 1996 and Kent came under the South Thames Regional Health Authority.  Kent had an area health authority from 1974 until 1982 when it was divided into five district health authorities: Canterbury and Thanet; Dartford and Gravesham; Maidstone; Medway; South East Kent; and Tunbridge Wells. in 1993 these were amalgamated into two - West Kent and East Kent. Regional health authorities were reorganised and renamed strategic health authorities in 2002. Kent was under Kent and Medway SHA. In 2006 regions were again reorganised and Kent came under NHS South East Coast until that was abolished in 2013. There were three primary care trusts for the area: NHS Eastern and Coastal Kent; NHS West Kent; NHS Medway up until April 2013. After this eight clinical commissioning groups were established, being Canterbury and Coastal; Dartford Gravesham and Swanley; Medway; South Kent Coast; Swale; Thanet; West Kent; and Ashford. These were given conditional approval to amalgamate in October 2019 and this progressed with formal approval on 20 March 2020 to the formation of the Kent & Medway Clinical Commissioning Group on 1 April 2020.\n\n\n== Sustainability and transformation plans ==\n\nKent (and Medway) formed a sustainability and transformation plan area in March 2016 with Glenn Douglas, the Chief Executive of Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust as its leader.  He was appointed accountable officer for all six CCGs in March 2018, having left the Trust. The subsequent establishment of a Kent & Medway Clinical Commissioning Group in 2020 evolved from this structure. \nIn February 2018 it was reported that the Encompass project in Whitstable, Faversham & Canterbury had seen a 7.3% reduction in the emergency admissions rate in the area between 2014-15 and the 12 months to September 2017.A health and social care shared record system, the Kent and Medway Care Record, was launched in the county in December 2020.  It includes data feeds from the four acute hospital trusts, three community services providers, two community-based mental health services providers, 225 main GP practices and 85 branch sites, and around 466 social care teams based in local authorities.  Patients are able to access their own records. \n\n\n== Commissioning issues ==\nCommunity services are provided by Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust and Medway Community Healthcare.  Community services in north Kent were transferred to Virgin Care by Swale CCG and  Dartford, Gravesham and Swanley CCG in January 2016 in a contract for \u00a318 million a year for the next seven years from April 2016 with an option to extend by a further three years.   Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust started proceedings for a judicial review of the decision in February 2016.  They claimed that Virgin could not deliver the contract.West Kent Clinical Commissioning Group cancelled all 1,700 non-emergency operations due before April in February 2017 to save \u00a33.2 million by delaying them until the new financial year.It appeared in February 2018 that all the eight CCGs in Kent and Medway were contemplating a merger.\nFinancial issues in three of the four East Kent CCGs and all four being placed in special measures resulted in August 2018 of an amalgamation of management functions (some other commissioning functions had been long aligned)The clinical commissioning groups in Kent were asked in September 2018 to find an extra \u00a32 million a year for the wheelchair service, operated by Millbrook Healthcare, which has a contract worth \u00a36.2 million a year because of the increasing complexity of cases.\n\n\n== Primary and community care ==\nThere are 262 GP practices in the county. Out-of-hours services are provided by IC24. In East Kent they were taken over by Primecare in early 2017. The contract envisaged integrating NHS 111 and GP out-of-hours services.  Primecare was placed in special measures in August 2017 by the Care Quality Commission after it was rated inadequate \u2013 only seven months after it started full operations.  It is to hand back the 3 year contract in July 2018.Whitstable is one of the areas selected to pilot Multispecialty community providers, under the Five Year Forward View.   Whitstable Medical Practice, with 53,000 patients, is one of the largest in England and is proposing to build a new community hospital and a \"

The Austrians, though outnumbered, fought hard until Napoleon arrived, when the battle subsequently became a clear French victory.\n\n\n== Prelude ==\nThere were in fact two engagements at Landshut. The first occurred on 16 April when Hiller pushed a defending Bavarian division out of the town. Five days later, after the French victory at Abensberg, the left wing of the Austrian army (36,000 men) withdrew on Landshut (this force was once more led by Hiller). Napoleon believed that this was the main Austrian army and ordered Lannes to pursue the enemy. Lannes\u2019s troops caught up with Hiller on the twenty-first. Hiller had decided to defend Landshut to allow his baggage train to withdraw. At Landshut the Isar river was spanned by two bridges with a small island in the center. Hiller had positioned cavalry outposts to the north of the town. His main force was deployed in Landshut and to the south on higher ground. Early in the morning Hiller was informed that a French force (57,000 men) had crossed the Isar upstream at Moosburg. Mass\u00e9na led this force.\n\n\n== The battle ==\nHiller realized that he would be unable to hold his position for long, as Mass\u00e9na was trying to block him from escaping. At this point his cavalry were forced back by Lannes\u2019s troops and the Austrians were pushed back into Landshut. The French now quickly seized the northern bridge over the river, and the Austrians withdrew into the main part of the town to defend the southern bridge. The Austrians tried to set fire to this second bridge, but owing to the rainfall over the previous days, this was only partially successful. However the Austrians did manage to close the gates at the end of the bridge. The French were now faced with attacking across the smoldering bridge. Napoleon ordered his aide General Georges Mouton (later comte de Lobau) to assume command of the attacking grenadiers of the 17th Line. In the face of heavy Austrian fire from all sides, Mouton ordered his men to attack without firing their muskets. The grenadiers reached the gateway and broke it down, allowing Bavarian troops to quickly reinforce the breach.The fighting now continued in the streets of Landshut itself. However the French had crossed a bridge immediately to the west of the town and were now entering Landshut from the south.\n\n\n== Consequences ==\nMany of the defenders were captured, but Hiller was able to retreat with the bulk of his force toward Neumarkt am Wallersee. Landshut finally fell to the French just after noon. The Austrian force had suffered around 10,000 casualties as well as losing 30 cannon, but more importantly they had lost many caissons, a pontoon train, and thousands of supply wagons. The victorious French forces spent much of the afternoon ransacking these supplies.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBaker, Ralph (2006).  Gregory Fremont-Barnes (ed.).

There prove to be many places where there are distinctive inconsistent insights; see Mortensen (1995) for example.

On October 4, 2007 the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) received applications for new radio stations in Ottawa to operate at 99.7 MHz. Three applicants have proposed the 99.7 MHz frequency, however, CIIO-FM planned to increase their effective radiated power. CIIO's application to increase power was denied on August 26, 2008. On the same date, a new radio station owned by Astral Media was authorized to broadcast at 99.7 FM in Ottawa, forcing CIIO to relocate to a new frequency; the new station, CJOT-FM, signed on on May 27, 2010.\nIn May 2010 the CRTC authorized CIIO-FM to move to 97.5 MHz.As of December 2010, the station CIIO-FM was listed as 96.1 MHz, while VF2516 was listed at 97.5 MHz in Ottawa which was known as CIIF-FM.\nOn December 7, 2011, Jack McGaw and Information Radio have applied to delete their French language Information Radio service CIIF-FM 97.5 in Ottawa and replace it with their English language service CIIO-FM 99.7 which was forced off the air when Astral's CJOT-FM was launched in 2010.

"M58_motorway| Motorways in England| Roads in Lancashire| Roads in Greater Manchester| Roads in Merseyside| ","The M58 is a motorway passing through Merseyside and Lancashire, terminating in Greater Manchester. It is 12 miles (19.3 km) long and provides a link between the M6 motorway and the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton and hence on, via the A5036, to the Mersey docks in Liverpool and Birkenhead.\n\n\n== Route ==\nApart from the approaches to its terminal roundabouts, the motorway is three lanes throughout.  It starts at Switch Island in Merseyside and passes directly underneath the Merseyrail Northern Line. before striking out across open countryside and into Lancashire south of Maghull and Bickerstaffe.  It then curves south Easterly south of Skelmersdale before reaching the M6 at Orrell in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, Greater Manchester.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince 1949 an upgrade of the Wigan to Ormskirk route had been proposed to improve traffic flows, yet with the decision in 1961 to develop Skelmersdale as a new town, the proposals were revised to provide a link to the M6 at one end and Liverpool at the other.The first part of the road was opened in March 1968 as the Skelmersdale Regional Road between what is now junctions 4 & 5.  It was originally a two lane single carriageway road that was upgraded to 2 lane plus with hard shoulders in 1973.The next stage was to connect this road to the M6 and construction on this part began in 1968 and it was opened to traffic in October 1970 as all purpose dual carriageway.  Now junctions 5 to 6, this road was upgraded to dual 3 lanes with a hard shoulder in 1977.  These roads were upgraded to motorway status in 1977.Construction on Switch Island to junction 4 section began in 1978 with the road opening between April and September 1980.\n\n\n=== Unfulfilled plans ===\nJunction 2 was not built, and was the end of a proposed motorway to Preston.  This was originally given the designation A59(M) as an upgrade to the A59 and later referred to as the M59.  However these proposals were dropped in favour of improvements to the existing A59.\nAt Switch Island, the junction has been built to allow an extension of the M57  and the end of M58 has provision for slip roads to the extension to be constructed.Lancashire County Council had in 1949 also proposed a Wigan to Bolton road. Bridges had been built on the M61 to allow for this eventual continuation.  Later plans saw the road downgraded to an A road; it would have reached the M61 between junctions 5 and 6.  These plans have also been dropped and currently Wigan Borough Council has plans for a part dual and part single carriageway route to the A579 near Atherton.\n\n\n== Junctions ==\n\nData from driver location signs are used to provide  distance information.\nThere was a recent addition of an exit on the eastbound side of the motorway at J1 allowing access to people travelling from main Liverpool destinations towards Maghull, Kirkby and Southport. Drivers used to have to travel to J3 and re-join the carriageway on the opposite side to exit at J1\nNote:  There is no Junction 2.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of motorways in the United Kingdom\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Media related to M58 motorway at Wikimedia Commons\nMotorway Database \u2013 M58\nLancashire County Council \u2013 Historic Highways \u2013 M58\nThe Motorway Archive \u2013 M58"
