"Kesar| Balaji Telefilms television series| StarPlus original programming| Indian television series| 2004 Indian television series debuts| 2007 Indian television series endings| Television shows set in Punjab, India| ","Kesar (saffron) is an Indian television serial that aired on Star Plus from 19 April 2004 to 31 May 2007. The story follows the life of a young girl named Kesar.\nThe series was supposed to go on air as Karvachauth on Zee TV. However, as things didn't work out between the channel and production house, it was later granted permission by Star Plus and it went on air as Kesar.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nKesar (Nandini Singh) is a traditional Punjabi girl living with her large extended family in a village. She gets an offer of marriage from the wealthy Maliya family, living in a big city. Kesar marries Rudra (Nikhil Arya), the son of the Maliyas. She tries her best to cope with the sophisticated urban lifestyle of her new family. But soon she finds herself trapped in a web of deceit. It is revealed that Rudra and his mother Pam have conspired against the innocent Kesar for the sake of some valuable inheritance. Kesar's life goes through a great deal of turmoil. She finds support from Rudra's friend Abhi, who loves her selflessly. But Abhi dies a tragic and early death. His heart is transplanted into the body of Harman (Yash Tonk), who begins to experience the same feelings of love for Kesar. Meanwhile, Kesar has given birth to Rudra's daughter Muskaan. Rudra dies in a bomb blast. After many more troubles, Kesar decides to marry Harman. However, they are separated by adverse circumstances.\nGoing through these vicissitudes, Kesar gets a new face and identity as Kavita (played by Prachi Shah). She marries Police Commissioner Arjun Gill and brings up Abhimanyu, his son from his first marriage, as her own. She continues to miss her daughter Muskaan and her adopted son Krish. Later on, Kesar is reunited with her daughter Muskaan. The secret that Kesar and Kavita are the same person comes out before everyone. Kesar continues to live with Arjun  and Muskaan. Krish lives with Harman. Harman is married to Nupur but remains good friends with Kesar.\nNupur becomes jealous of Harman and Kesar's relationship. Nupur tries to kill Kesar, but instead hurts Harman and he became blind. The only person to know this is Nupur and Harman's daughter Khwaish. Krish meets Khushali, and they fall in love. Muskaan and Rohan meet and fall in love too. On their engagement night, Kesar finds out Rohan's real name is Ajay and he was married before. Krish and Khushali get engaged but Muskaan and Rohan do not. Rohan leaves the house but tells everyone that he had already informed Muskaan about this truth in a CD. However, Muskaan never managed to watch it. Later, the misunderstanding is cleared up. Muskaan decides to get back with Rohan, but on her engagement night, she is almost strangled to death. The person who wants to kill Muskaan is Naina, her wedding planner. Naina has loved Rohan for a long time but he does not love her. On Muskaan and Rohan's wedding day, police arrest him for killing his first wife. Naina is actually the one who has killed Rohan's first wife. She gathers evidence against Rohan and shows it to the police, so that his marriage will be delayed. Kesar and Arjun support Rohan. They compel Naina to admit that she killed Rohan's first wife. Naina then commits suicide.\nMuskaan and Rohan get together. Then, on the day of their marriage, Muskaan refuses to marry Rohan. Abhimanyu is in love with Muskaan and has confessed his love for her. Then he rapes her. This matter is taken to court. Meanwhile, Nupur tells Harman that she is the reason behind his going blind. Nupur gets shot and dies. Then, one day, Arjun tries to kill Harman. The reason is that Arjun is jealous of Harman's friendship with Kesar. However, Harman tells Arjun that his eyes have healed and he can see. Arjun is shocked to hear this. Kesar then brings the police and they arrest Arjun. Meanwhile, Muskaan and Rohan have got married. But Rohan beats up Muskaan, because he thinks that she and Abhimanyu are having an affair. When Rohan realises that it is not so, he apologises to Muskaan, but she doesn't forgive him. Muskaan and Kesar then move in with Harman, Krish, Khushali and Khwaish. They all live happily in Harman's house.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nNandini Singh as Kesar Rudra Maliya  / Kesar Abhinav Pandey / Kesar Rudra Maliya\nNandini Singh as Dr. Kangana Husband Dr Rudra Maliya (Kesar's Look Alike)\nPrachi Shah as Kesar Abhinav Arjun Gill / Kavita Face Surgery\nEijaz Khan as Abhinav (Abhi) Pandey\nYash Tonk as Harman Khanna\nNikhil Arya as Rudra Maliya\nSandiip Sikcand / Shakti Singh as Parmeet\nIndira Krishnan as Teji\nMadan Joshi as Dharam Maliya\nSurekha Sikri as Saroj Dharam Maliya\nKitu Gidwani / Natasha Rana as Pam Vikram Maliya\nRocky Verma as Inspector Yashwant Patil\nKaran Patel as Ryan Sood\nKanika Kohli as Nitika Maliya / Nitika Ryan Sood\nHiten Tejwani as Abhinav (Abhi) Pandey\nNisha Rawal as Binita\nAleeza Khan / Ashita Dhawan as Neha\nGunjan Walia as Riya Maliya\nShubhangi Gokhale as Harman's Aunt\nKhyaati Khandke Keswani as Katrina Rudra Maliya\nShivalika Sharma as Nupur Harman Khanna\nNishant Shokeen as Aseem\nVineet Sharma as Shivam\nIqbal Azad as  Police Commissioner Arjun Gill\nShweta Rastogi as Muskaan Maliya\nAmit Dolawat as Krish Maliya\nAshish Sharma as Abhimanyu Gill\nGunjan Vijaya as Khwaish Khanna\nAnkita Bhargava as Khushali\nPoonam Gulati as Naina\nVishal Watwani as Anand Pandey (Abhinav's Younger Brother)\nPratima Kazmi as Shakuntala Pandey (Abhinav & Anand's Mother)\nSanjay Batra as Vikram Maliya\nSonali Verma as Reema Vikram Maliya\nJaya Bhattacharya as Reema Sood\nKavita Kaushik as Kadambari Abhinav Pandey\nNasirr Khan as Komal\nAnas Rashid as Dr. Sahil\nMonalika Bhonsle as Shalini Sood\nMazher Sayed as Dr. Walia\nShweta Tiwari as Prerna\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKesar at IMDb\nOfficial website on TV Asia\nOfficial website on STAR Plus"
"MMP14| Genes on human chromosome 14| Matrix metalloproteinases| EC 3.4.24| Human chromosome 14 gene stubs| ","Matrix metalloproteinase-14 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the MMP14 gene.\n\n\n== Function ==\nProteins of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. Deficits in MMP14 leads to premature aging, short lifespan, and cell senescence in mice, suggesting an important role of MMP14 in extracellular matrix remodeling during aging. Most MMP's are secreted as inactive pro-proteins which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases.\nHowever, the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the membrane-type MMP (MT-MMP) subfamily; each member of this subfamily contains a potential transmembrane domain suggesting that these proteins are tethered to the cell surface rather than secreted.\n\"
"Omandongo| Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Mission mission stations in Ondonga| Oshikoto Region| Geography of Namibia| ","Omandongo is an unpopulated place in the Onayena Constituency in the Oshikoto Region in Northern Namibia, and the region which used to be called Ovamboland.\nThe Finnish Missionary Society began its missionary work in Omandongo in 1870. This was the first mission station for Finnish missionaries in the whole world. It was occupied by Finnish missionaries during 1870\u201388.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first missionaries of the Finnish Missionary Society arrived in Omandongo on 9 July 1870 from Otjimbingwe in the Hereroland via Omaruru. Omandongo was part of the kingdom of the King Shikongo of Ondonga.\nWhen the Finns arrived there, there was one structure at Omandongo, a house that had been built by Frederick Green, assistant to the merchant Andersson. It had been donated to Carl Hugo Hahn of the Rhenish Mission, and he in turn gave it to the Finns.\nThe Finns who arrived in Omandongo were the following:\nNotes:\na Note: In official works of history the first term of these missionaries is given as having begun in 1868, because they arrived on 30 December that year in Cape Town and on to Stellenbosch on the same day.b Piirainen acted during 1874\u20131910 as the FMS representative in Omaruru in Hereroland.The Omandongo mission station had to be abandoned in late September or early October 1888, because of the despotic behaviour of Prince Nehale of Ondonga. His men murdered a South African merchant named William Jordan practically in the yard of the mission station. Nehale\u2019s men also tried to \u201cpurchase\u201d an ox cart from the Finns, apparently offering nothing as compensation. The Finns then fled to King Kambonde in Olukonda.\nIn Ondonga, the work of the missionaries soon expanded so that several new mission stations were founded. These were Olukonda (1871\u2013), Oniipa (1872\u201376, 1888\u2013), Ondjumba (1872\u201376) and Omulonga (1874\u20131888).Later also the following mission stations were founded in Ondonga: Ondangwa (1890\u20131913, from 1915 on a government station) and Ontananga (1900\u2013), Onayena (1902\u201306, 1907\u2013), Oshigambo (1908\u2013) and Onandjokwe (1910\u2013).Oniipa, Onandjokwe and Oshigambo had the longest life as mission stations. (The end of this history is not given here, since the sources used do not extend to the end of this the time period. These former mission stations continue as important centres of the activities of the ELCIN church.)\n\n\n== Festive occasions ==\n\n\n=== 30 year celebrations ===\nThe 30th anniversary of the arrival of the Finnish missionaries was celebrated at Olukonda, since Omandongo had been abandoned already years earlier. The festivities were conducted on 7 July 1900. Among those present was the director of the Finnish Missionary Society, the Rev. Jooseppi Mustakallio. The festivities were conducted out of doors, and there were 600 people present.\n\n\n=== Centennial celebrations ===\nThe centennial celebrations of missionary  work in Ovamboland were held at Omandongo in July 1970. There was a large wooden cross at the site, and the first number was a re-enactment of the arrival of the missionaries 100 years earlier. Several male missionaries, with their safari helmets on, acted the roles of the original arrivals on ox carts. Students of the Engela Parish Institute acted the part of the indigenes.It was estimated that at least 5500 persons participated, since there was a special badge on sale and this was the number of badges sold. But many people also were present without badges, according to various estimates 1000 persons or even 2000 persons.\nThe liturgy of the festive service was conducted by Mikko Iham\u00e4ki and Bishop Leonard Auala, and the sermon was held by Kleopas Dumeni. The festivities were led by the Rev. Matias Ngipandula.28 speeches were held at the festivities, 15 of which were interpreted to other languages. Seven choirs performed, and they sand altogether 18 songs. Among the performers was also the brass band of the Rhenish Mission youth. Five plays were also performed during the festivities.The festivities had an ecumenical aspect, as several Christian denominations were represented, among the not only Lutheran Ovambos but also Lutheran Hereros, belonging to a different church, as well as the Reformed Christian, Anglicans and Roman Catholics. The government of South Africa was represented by Chief Commissar J. M. de Wet, who emphasised that the Ovambos, the Boers and the Finns must work together in order to improve the situation of the OvambosEverything went peacefully, and the biggest problem was caused by a couple of scorpion stings.The wooden cross at the site has since been burned, apparently as a wanton act.\n\n\n== Finns buried in Omandongo ==\nHenrik Rautanen (d. 1880).\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPeltola, Matti (1958).

It consists of a bronze rendition of Cort\u00e9s designed by Eduardo Barr\u00f3n on top of a stone pedestal.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nThe first one to come up with the idea of erecting a monument to Cort\u00e9s in Medell\u00edn was Carolina Coronado, formulating it as early as 1845, predating a 1858 public petition. However the realization of such plans would take decades. The project was eventually awarded to Eduardo Barr\u00f3n. The model of the statue was sculpted in Rome, although the bronze was cast in Barcelona. It was funded by the Provincial Deputation of Badajoz and the Spanish State. Meanwhile, the bronze, obtained from cannons, was financed by Carlos Groizard y Coronado.\n\nThe bronze statue of Cort\u00e9s is depicted wearing armor, stepping on some Mexica idols while raising the banner of the Cross.

In the 1980s, AST designed add-on expansion cards, and toward the 1990s evolved into a major personal computer manufacturer. AST was acquired by Samsung Electronics in 1997, but was forced to close in 1999 due to a series of losses.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Expansion cards ===\n\nAST's original business was the manufacture and marketing of a broad range of microcomputer expansion cards, later focusing on higher-density replacements for the standard I/O cards in the IBM PC. A typical AST multifunction card of the mid-1980s would have an RS-232 serial port, a parallel printer port, a battery-backed clock/calendar (the original IBM PC did not have one), a game port, and 384 KB of DRAM (added to the 256 KB on the motherboard to reach the full complement of 640 KB) - marketed under the product name 'SixPakPlus'. A similar expansion card was produced for the 8-bit Apple II, named the AST Multi I/O, which offered a serial and parallel interface, plus a battery-backed clock/calendar.\nIn 1987, AST produced a pair of expansions cards for the Apple IIGS computer: The RamStakPlus, a dual RAM/ROM memory expansion card; and the AST Vision Plus, a real-time video digitizer card. The latter card was eventually sold to Silicon & Software and licensed and sold through Virtual Realities (and later LRO and then Alltech Electronics). AST Research also produced for the Macintosh line the Mac286, a pair of NuBus cards containing an Intel 80286 and RAM, allowing a Macintosh to run MS-DOS side by side with its existing operating system. These cards were announced in March 1987 alongside Apple's Macintosh II line. The product line was eventually sold to Orange Micro, which developed the concept further.\n\n\n=== Personal computers ===\n\nAs PC manufacturers improved the integration of peripheral controllers on their motherboards, AST's original business began to shrink, and the company developed its own line of PCs, for the desktop, mobile, and server markets.\nAST was one of the members of the Gang of Nine which developed the EISA bus.\nIn 1992, AST became a Fortune 500 company at place 431.\nAST computer's reliability was considered close to that of quality leaders Compaq, Gateway, and IBM. AST gained a decent share of the PC market, but never came close to overtaking Compaq and Dell. During 1992\u20131995, AST owned the largest market share in China with Legend (now Lenovo) as the largest local reseller of AST computer.\nIn 1993, Radio Shack sold its computer manufacturing division to AST, and in 1994 they reached a deal to sell AST computers in Radio Shack stores. A year later, the electronics chain started selling IBM-brand computers instead.\n\n\n=== Decline ===\nAST's fortunes shrunk due to the strategy of offering premium models in an increasingly competitive personal computer market, while Compaq Computer Corporation and other top-tier manufacturers slashed prices to go head-to-head with the cheapest clones. The failure of AST to recognize the movement towards the commoditization of the PC contributed to its downturn.  AST insisted on developing and using its own components in the PCs it produced, instead of those of specialized OEMs. One often used saying at AST, in an attempt to dismiss such competitors, was \"

"State_Supplementation_Program| Government aid programs| Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program| ","The State Supplement Program (SSP or SSI/SSP), not to be confused with SNAP, is the state supplement to the U.S. federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program and provides state funded supplement benefits to SSI recipients.This program aims at providing a complementary financial support to individuals and couples who are elderly (usually 65 years of age and older), legally blind, or partially or fully disabled. The financial support can be considered as a global support, as it is not tied to any kind of expense. It can be used in a variety of ways, from housekeeping once in a while to daily residential care for individuals for who certain everyday tasks are difficult or impossible to do by themselves.However, very few states apply the exact same criteria of eligibility as the federal ones. The states who do let the Social Security Administration manage their SSP (see section Apply for the State Supplement Program). \nExcept from the states of Arizona, Mississippi, North Dakota, Northern Mariana Islands, and West Virginia; every state currently offers a state supplement to the federal SSI through the State Supplement Program. The conditions of eligibility to the supplement and the amount vary between the different states. The amount of the SSP ranges from $10 to $400 depending on the state. In 2020, the maximum amount of the SSI is $783 per month for an eligible individual, and $1175 for an eligible couple.\n\n\n== Usual State Supplementation Program eligibility criteria ==\nSSP eligibility criteria vary between states but we can identify the following as being the most commun:\n\nGrandfathered SSI recipients;\nIndividuals with an ineligible spouse;\nSSI recipients who are over age 65;\nSSI recipients who are blind or disabled;\nIndividuals determined eligible for SSP by the Developmental Disabilities Administration; or;\nCertain individuals who are eligible for SSI and are in foster care \n\n\n== State Supplementation Program amount variation factors ==\nThe amount paid to an eligible person will be calculated based on the following factors:\n\nliving arrangements,\nincome; and\ncounty of residenceThese primary factors serve as a base to determine individual needs. The states who administer the SSP themselves may use additional factors to determine the amount which will be paid.\n\n\n== Apply for the State Supplement Program ==\nThe application for the SSP has to be done to the state directly.\nIn some states however, no application is necessary as the state supplement is administered by the Social Security Administration. The Social Security Administration will determine the eligibility of the citizens in these states and pay the SSP along with the SSI. The states for which the SSP is administered by the Social Security Administration are the following: California, Hawaii, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, and Vermont.\nIn these states, only one payment is made to include both the SSI and the SSP, combining federal and state benefits.\nIn some states, SSP is dually administrated. Social Security administers some categories of State supplement payments, while the State administers other categories of supplemental payments. The states with a dual administration of the SSP are Delaware, District of Columbia, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. It is therefore necessary to check with the state if is eligible to the SSP under the federal or state criterions.\n\n\n== Amount of the benefits when the State Supplement Program is partially or fully administered by the Social Security Administration in 2020 ==\n\n\n== End of the benefits of the State Supplement Program ==\nA person will benefit from the State Supplement Program for as long as they fit the eligibility criterions set by the state. The payments will automatically stop if they do not fit the criterions anymore. Furthermore, any change in a person\u2019s living arrangements must be reported to the authority issuing the payments and can lead to an adjustment of the amount paid to the person. \nShould a person not be eligible to receive the SSI anymore, they will not be a part of the SSP as well as the SSP is a complementary program to the federal Supplementary Security Income program.\n\n\n== Specificities by state (non exhaustive list) ==\n\n\n=== Massachusetts ===\nIt is possible not be to eligible for SSI but to be eligible for Massachusetts\u2019 SSP. That is because the maximum income to be eligible for SSP in Massachusetts is higher than the one set for the federal SSI.\nHowever, in order to apply for the SSP, it is needed to apply for SSI first even a person is not eligible for the SSI but only for the SSP.\nBenefits are paid at the beginning of each month.\n\n\n=== New Hampshire ===\nEligibility criteria in New Hampshire are the following:\n\nbeing a resident of 65 years of age or older;\nbeing a resident between the ages of 18 and 64, and is determined by the State to be physically or mentally disabled, partially or fully; and\nbeing a resident of any age who is determined by the State to be legally blind.\n\n\n== References =="

Her research makes use of remote sensing technology to understand the characteristics of plant communities.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nUstin is from Eugene, Oregon. After graduating from high school in 1961, Ustin moved to San Francisco with her friends. She was inspired by the city's activism, in particular the civil rights movement and environmental advocates. She first studied biology at California State University, East Bay, specialising in plant physiological ecology. She remained there for a master's degree, before moving to the University of California, Davis for her doctoral degree. Alongside her doctoral research Ustin started working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. She started working on remote sensing technology in the early 1980s, when the field was then in its infancy.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nHer work considers remote sensing of environmental and landscape properties, making use of hyperspectral analysis and thermal scanners. Remote sensing has since been used to monitor natural disasters, study climate changes and monitor air pollution. Over the course of her career, Ustin made use of remote sensing data from five different continents, including tracking the impacts of agriculture on forests and monitoring invasive plant species.Ustin held several positions at University of California, Davis, including serving as Director of both the Center for Spatial Technology and Remote Sensing and the John Muir Institute of the Environment. She worked with NASA to build space-based imaging spectrometers.\nIn 2020 Ustin was elected to the Ecological Society of America. Her citation read, \u201cElected for research pioneering the use of remote sensing technology for detecting changes in plant community characteristics, biological diversity, and land use, and for her continued influence on the field,\u201d.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2010 Honorary Doctorate from the University of Zurich\n2017 Elected Fellow of the American Geophysical Union\n2020 Elected Fellow of the Ecological Society of America\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nRoberts, D.A.; Gardner, M.; Church, R.; Ustin, S.; Scheer, G.; Green, R.O.

"Holcomb_Valley| Mining in California| Valleys of San Bernardino County, California| San Bernardino Mountains| Gold mining| American gold rushes| Valleys of California| ","Holcomb Valley, located in the San Bernardino Mountains about five miles north of Big Bear Lake, was the site of the most gold mines in Southern California. It was named after William F. Holcomb, who found gold there in 1860. That year started the largest gold rush in the Southern California region.  The boomtown of Belleville grew up near there and flourished for about ten years before being abandoned. The site is now registered as California Historical Landmark #619.\n\n\n== Gold ==\nIn May 1860, gold was found there by William F. Holcomb and Ben Choteau.  They were miners who had been prospecting at Bear Valley. Holcomb found gold while he was tracking a bear in the valley later named after him. After Holcomb and Ben Ware filed mine claims on five sites in May 1860 at the County Recorder's office, word spread quickly and prospectors rushed to the area.Before long, a gold camp sprang up within 150 inches of where the gold was found. It became a town and, after the first child Belle was born, the new town was named Belleville in her honor. It soon became the largest town in San Bernardino County with a population of about 1,500. \nOften perpetuated by local newsmen, is the myth that Belleville was almost once the County seat. The story goes that Belleville residents felt they deserved the honor of being the county seat and placed this measure on the ballot in either 1860 or 1861. After the election, ballots were being counted at the County Court House (in San Bernardino City) around an open bonfire when one of the ballot boxes, allegedly from Belleville, was accidentally, kicked into the fire and destroyed. When the count was completed, Belleville had lost the county seat election by the slim margin of two votes. \nHowever, the California Constitution allows for a change in county seat only through legislative action in which it may directly decide the location, or delegate the authority to the voters of the county, which would require it to be placed on the local ballot. There was no legislative act on record in State Records to change the county seat from San Bernardino to Belleville, in any year, let alone 1860 or 1861. Any item up for election on the local ballot was required to be posted in the local newspaper. The only items published in both 1860 and 1861 were the names of the people running for office and school bonds. The items up for election are also required to be listed in the Board of Supervisor minutes, there is no such listing for the change of the County seat. Also there is no mention of the election or missing ballots in Holcomb's recollections which were written in the 1870s only a few years later at the behest of the San Bernardino Pioneer Society. \nBelleville was a place filled with rough characters competing over gold, it was considered a place of violence and hanging justice. It was the third and fourth largest town in Southern California during these yearsHolcomb Valley produced the most wealth from gold of any Southern California mining district. With time, major placer and quartz mining declined, followed by the departure of most of the population of Belleville after 1870. Hard rock mining continued at the Gold Mountain Mine until 1919.  Some mining activity continues today, with 2,000 claims by hobbyists.The valley is the site of the Holcomb Valley Scout Ranch (formerly of Old Baldy Council), on the site of the old Hitchcock Ranch. It provides opportunities for youth to have experience in ranching, hiking and related outdoor activities.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCalifornia Gold Rush\nThe Night of the Grizzly\nCalifornia Historical Landmarks in San Bernardino County, California\n\n\n== References =="

"City_Art_Centre| Art museums and galleries in Edinburgh| ","The City Art Centre is part of the Museums & Galleries Edinburgh, which sits under the Culture directorate of the City of Edinburgh Council. The City Art Centre has a collection which include historic and modern Scottish painting and photography, as well as contemporary art and craft. It is an exhibition based venue with no permanent displays.\nThe City Art Centre is home to the City of Edinburgh's Recognised collection of Scottish Art. Edinburgh's fine art collection is approximately 4,800 pieces of Scottish work in a variety of mediums. Artists such Fergusson, Eardley, Paolozzi are represented in the collection as well as many other Edinburgh based and Scottish artists. Artists are represented dating from the 17th century to the present day.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1971 the City Art Centre was housed in the former Royal High School. In 1975 the reform of the Scottish local government brought the City Museums and the City Art Centre together the new council directorate of the Recreation Department. The City Art Centre was then rehoused to its current Market Street location in 1980.The current City Art Centre building dates  from 1899 to 1902  and was the work of  Dunn and Findlay. Built as an extension to the Scotsman newspaper office, it later became part of the city\u2019s wholesale fruit and vegetable market.\nDesigned as a nine storey iron-framed warehouse, it is clad in stone to create a restrained Beaux Arts facade. It has public galleries on 6 floors.\nThe original conversion of the building in 1980 was undertaken by the City Architect's Department under the direction of the then City Architect, Brian Annable, and it garnered a RIBA Award for Architecture in 1983. In the 1990s more  space was created by extending into  the upper floors. Natural materials and neutral colours are used  throughout the interior to create flexible contemporary exhibition spaces.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\nIn 1961 Miss Jean Watson, an Edinburgh resident, at first gave and then later bequeathed money to create a collection of Scottish Art for the City of Edinburgh. The fund is administered by the City Council and is still in use today. Soon after Miss Watson gave her initial sum of money, a Committee was formed to administer the funds. One of their first decisions was to commission a bronze bust of Miss Watson herself from a sculptor, Eric Schilsky. From the outset, the Committee opted to purchase contemporary works of art by Scottish artists or artists based in Scotland. One of their first purchases was Obsession by John Bellany. Since then, more than 900 paintings, drawings, sculpture, photographs and prints have been added.  Works by contemporary artists such as Moyna Flannigan, Calum Colvin, Peter Howson and Dame Elizabeth Blackadder have all been acquired with Bequest Funds.In 1964 more than 300 of the works owned by the Scottish Modern Arts Association were donated to the City of Edinburgh during the dissolution of the Scottish Modern Arts Association. These are now housed in the City Art Centre.\nThe Scottish Arts Council began collecting in 1951, with a focus on the purchase of artworks by contemporary Scottish based artists. In the mid 1990s the Scottish Arts Council took the decision to distribute its collection of approximately 2,000 works by contemporary Scottish artists to museums and galleries throughout Scotland. Institutions were given the opportunity to view the collection and submit proposals for acquisition, the City Art Centre applied and in 1998 received 123 works of art.Through the National Collecting Scheme for Scotland, six major museums and art galleries, including the City Art Centre, have been able to acquire new works by contemporary artists. The Scheme has been in operation since 2003, and was established to assist museums and galleries throughout Scotland purchase work by contemporary artists and craft makers. To avoid duplication, each member gallery is invited to collect within a broad theme. In recognition of Edinburgh\u2019s World Heritage Site Status, the City Art Centre is acquiring works all of which have an urban or architectural theme. Since the scheme began, the City Art Centre have acquired a variety of work including film, photography and installation. Artists now represented include Toby Paterson, Christine Borland, Graham Fagen, Rosalind Nashashibi, Nathan Coley and Rose Frain.\nIn collaboration with Edinburgh Libraries, the Museums & Galleries Edinburgh show their collection on Capital Collections. Capital Collections is an image library which allows a selection of collections to be viewed.\n\n\n== References =="

"Toggenburg| Toggenburg| ","Toggenburg is a region of Switzerland. It corresponds to the upper valley of the river Thur and that of its main tributary, the Necker. Since 1 January 2003, Toggenburg has been a constituency (Wahlkreis) of the canton of St. Gallen (SFOS number 1727).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe valley descends in a northwestern direction from the watershed between the Rhine and the Thur, and is enclosed on the northeast by the chain of the S\u00e4ntis (8,216 ft [2,504 m]) and on the southwest by that of the Churfirsten (7,566 ft [2,306 m]) and of the Speer (6,411 ft [1,954 m]). It is a fertile valley of about 45 kilometres (28 mi) in length from the source of the river to Wil.At Wildhaus, the highest village (3,632 ft [1,107 m]), the house wherein Huldrych Zwingli, the Swiss Reformer, was born in 1484, is still shown. Other villages are Lichtensteig, Kirchberg and Wattwil.\n\n\n== History ==\nThere are traces of the paleolithic Mousterian Industry throughout the Appenzell Alps, in the Toggenburg notably in Wildenmannlisloch cave.\nThe upper Thur valley was part of the province of Raetia in the Roman era, and was reached by Alemannic-speaking settlers only in the early medieval period. This is evidenced by a substantial substrate of Romance toponyms in the upper Toggenburg (upstream of Stein).The name of the region is derived from that of the House of Toggenburg (named for their castle near Kirchberg) who ruled over parts of the Toggenburg region since the 12th century, in the 13th century taking the title of counts (comes) and extending their domain to include all of the upper Thur valley.\nThe extinction of the main line of the counts of Toggenburg  (1436) led to the Old Z\u00fcrich War (1440\u201346) ultimately resulting in the temporary expulsion of Z\u00fcrich from the Swiss confederacy. Eventually, the Toggenburg passed to the lord of Raron (in Valais), who sold it to the abbot of St. Gall in 1468.Part of the Toggenburg followed the Swiss Reformation led by Zwingli, and the valley declared itself independent in 1530, but was forced to re-submit to the Abbot of St. Gall in 1538. The Abbot was, however, pressured into toleration of either confession, so that the Toggenburg became one of the few regions of Switzerland where Catholicism and Protestantism have a tradition of co-existence.\nIn 1707, the Toggenburg again declared its independence of St. Gall, in reaction to the Abbey's plans to build a road across the Ricken Pass, which was seen as a strategic arrangement towards a Catholic military alliance. The ensuing Toggenburg war of 1712 resulted in a balance of power between Catholic and Protestant cantons, ultimately leading to the formation of Switzerland as a federal state.\nIn the Helvetic Republic, the Toggenburg was divided between the cantons of S\u00e4ntis and Linth. The parts were re-united as part of the canton of St. Gallen in 1803.\nSch\u00fcblig, a type of sausage is a tradition in the area.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe Toggenburg Wahlkreis has a population of 46,954 (as of 31 December 2020).

"Pueraria_montana| Pueraria| Taxa named by João de Loureiro| ","Pueraria montana is a species of plant in the botanical family Fabaceae. At least three sub-species (alternatively called varieties) are known. It is closely related to other species in the genus Pueraria (P. edulis and P. phaseoloides) and the common name kudzu is used for all of these species and hybrids between them. The morphological differences between them are subtle, they can breed with each other, and it appears that introduced kudzu populations in the United States have ancestry from more than one of the species.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIt is a seasonal climbing plant, growing high where suitable surfaces (trees, cliffs, walls) are available, and also growing as ground cover where there are no vertical surfaces. It is a perennial vine with tuberous roots and rope-like, dark brown stems to 20 m (65 ft) long. It grows up to 20 metres per year and can achieve a height of 30 metres. It has markedly hairy herbaceous stems.\nPueraria montana is native to East Asia, primarily subtropical and temperate regions of China, Japan, and Korea, with trifoliate leaves composed of three leaflets. Each leaflet is large and ovate with two to three lobes each and hair on the underside. The species can fix atmospheric nitrogen, which can supply up to 95% of leaf nitrogen to the plant in poor soils. Along the vines are nodes, points at which stems or tendrils can propagate to increase support and attach to structures. As a twining vine, kudzu uses stems or tendrils that can extend from any node on the vine to attach to and climb most surfaces. In addition, the nodes of the kudzu vine have the ability to root when exposed to soil, further anchoring the vine to the ground. The roots are tuberous and are high in starch and water content, and the twining of the plant allows for less carbon concentration in the construction of woody stems and greater concentration in roots, which aids root growth. The roots can account for up to 40% of total plant biomass.\n Flowers are reddish-purple and yellow, fragrant, similar to pea flowers, about 20\u201325 millimetres (0.79\u20130.98 in) wide and are produced at the leaf axis in elongated racemes about 20 centimetres (7.9 in) long. The flowering period extends from July through October. The fruit is a flat hairy pod about 8 centimetres (3.1 in) long with three seeds.\nKudzu's primary method of reproduction is asexual vegetative spread (cloning) which is aided by the ability to root wherever a stem is exposed to soil. For sexual reproduction, kudzu is entirely dependent on pollinators.Although kudzu prefers forest regrowth and edge habitats with high sun exposure, the plant can survive in full sun or partial shade. These attributes of kudzu made it attractive as an ornamental plant for shading porches in the Southeastern United States, but they facilitated the growth of kudzu as it became a \u201cstructural parasite\u201d of the southern states, enveloping entire structures when untreated and often referred to as \u201cthe vine that ate the south\u201d.\n\n\n== Subspecies and varieties ==\nPueraria montana var. chinensis (Ohwi) Sanjappa & Pradeep\nPueraria montana var. lobata (Willd.) Sanjappa & Pradeep\nPueraria montana var. thomsonii (Benth.) Wiersema ex D.B. Ward\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe Latin specific epithet montana refers to mountains or coming from mountains.\n\n\n== Invasive species ==\n\nThe natural range of Pueraria montana can be found in India, Myanmar, Indochina, China, Korea, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, the Pacific Islands, and in north Australia. In its native habitat, it and its closely related species occur across wide areas; the species have diverged genetically due to vicariance. Its invasiveness can be attributed to similarities between both native and newly invaded niches, effectively expanding its habitable range into areas with climates it may not be able to endure otherwise.Like other exotic species, the introduction to other areas is due to human actions. Seeds are spread by mammals and birds. Kudzu are plants adapted to drought. Only above ground portions are damaged by frost; thick storage roots grow as deep as 1 metre. It forms new perennial root crowns from stem nodes touching the ground.\nThe ecological requirements of the species are those of the subtropical and temperate habitat areas.In Europe, Pueraria montana grows in several places in the warm regions of Switzerland and Italy near Lake Maggiore and Lake Lugano.\nDuring World War II, kudzu was introduced to Vanuatu and Fiji by United States Armed Forces to serve as camouflage for equipment. It is now a major weed there.Pueraria montana is also becoming a problem in Queensland.\nIn the United States, Pueraria montana is extensively reported in the coastal states from eastern Texas to Florida, North to Maryland, as well as inland in Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Washington, D.C., and West Virginia. Since 2004, Kudzu has moved farther North along the Ohio River, appearing in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. Of all affected states, three in the southeast have the heaviest infestations: Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.\n\n\n== Effects on biodiversity ==\n\nDue to the aggressive, climbing nature of P. montana it often causes shading and death of native vegetation, resulting in a monoculture of P. montana. As P. montana spreads, it shades and crushes its competitors with its weight, eliminating everything in its path. As a result of growing over native plants and trees, it blocks their access of vital resources such as sunlight, killing off young vegetation. These result in dramatic reductions in native biodiversity at the local level.Other than the loss of biodiversity of plant species, P. montana may have a negative effect on animals. Many plant species that are suppressed by P. montana because of its uncontrolled and rapid growth negatively impacts some wildlife animals that have specific mutualisms or feeding relationships with these plant species. This potentially could lead to the death of certain animal species, specifically herbivores, that depend on some vegetation as a resource for both food and shelter. These are important factors that lead to habitat destruction and reduction in animal biodiversity.\n\n\n== Impacts of global changes ==\nChanges in the global environment such as higher CO2 levels, higher temperatures, greater rates of nitrogen deposition, and greater fragmentation of natural habitats are predicted to increase the spread of P. montana.\n\n\n=== Carbon dioxide ===\nKudzu is highly responsive to increased CO2 levels as it results in maximal leaf expansion, increase in leaf size, and an overall 12% increase in leaf production.  In turn, the plant has higher turgor pressure which results in the improvements in its growth potential. As the atmospheric CO2 concentration continues to rise, it is possible for the potential enhancement of P. montana\u2019s invasiveness.\n\n\n=== Temperature ===\nWith global warming, overnight temperatures tend to increase. Data collected in the United States over the past few decades showed a reduction in frost days, an earlier date for the last freeze in spring, and a later date for the first freeze in fall. These favour the spread of  P. montana.  \nThe northward distribution of P. montana is hypothesized to be limited by low temperatures. Cold temperatures cause their leaves to be killed off and their leaf expansion to be lagged. However, with the continuous rise in global temperature, it is predicted that P. montana will rapidly spread northward as a result of the increased number of warmer days.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nL.

The A350 follows a lower route through villages in the Blackmore Vale.  However, much traffic uses the hilltop route as an alternative because it is straighter and passes through fewer villages. Melbury Abbas is the only bottleneck on this road, where it dips down into the valley and becomes narrower. \nDorset County Council have considered bypass schemes, but none has got further than preliminary because Melbury Abbas village is surrounded by conservation land.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Melbury Abbas at Wikimedia Commons"

"Leaf_curl| Fungal tree pathogens and diseases| Viral plant pathogens and diseases| Stone fruit tree diseases| Leaf diseases| ","Peach leaf curl is a plant disease characterized by distortion and coloration of leaves and is caused by the fungus Taphrina deformans, which infects peach, nectarine, and almond trees.  T. deformans is found in the United States, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Peach leaf curl reduces the amount of leaves and fruit produced by peach and nectarine trees.\n\n\n== Affected species ==\nPeach leaf curl mainly affects peach, nectarine, and almond trees. Apricots are generally immune to peach leaf curl (instead, the major apricot diseases are blossom wilt and branch dieback caused by Monilinia fructicola in the spring and Eutypa lata in the summer). However, in an isolated case in Hungary in 2011, peach leaf curl was also identified in apricot trees.\n\n\n== Symptoms ==\nPeach leaf curl is a distinctive and easily noticeable fungal disease, and the severity of the symptoms depends on how early infection has occurred. Diseased leaves can usually be identified soon after they emerge from the bud, due to their red color and twisted shape. As the leaves develop, they become increasingly distorted, and ultimately thick and rubbery compared to normal leaves. The color of the leaves changes from the normal green to red and purple, until a whitish bloom covers each leaf. Finally, the dead leaf may dry and turn black before it is cast off. Changes in the bark are less noticeable, if at all. Fruit may fail to develop from diseased blossoms. Any fruit that does develop from a diseased tree is usually normal, but sometimes may also be affected, showing a reddish color.  Infected leaves fall early. The tree usually produces a second flush of leaves that is rarely diseased, except in an unseasonably cool and wet spring, because the fungus is not infectious at the normally higher temperatures in late spring and early summer.\n\n\n== Cause of peach leaf curl ==\nThe fungus T. deformans causes deformed young leaves, red blisters, and ultimately the whitish bloom that covers the leaf as the infection progresses. This white color is made of asci that break through the cuticle of the leaf. One ascus consists of eight ascospores that create conidia, which are ejected in early summer and spread by rain and wind. The fungus survives the winter on the surface of the host plant, such as on bark or buds. In late winter or early spring, rainwater washes spores into the buds as they burst. Once this happens, no treatment is effective. In the spring, about two weeks after blossom, new leaves emerging from the infected buds are infected by the conidia. The disease may not occur every year due to variation in temperature and rainfall. Specifically, for successful infection, the fungus requires wet winters, where rain (not fog or dew) wets the tree for more than 12.5 hours at temperatures below 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F). The fungus cannot grow at temperatures below 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Control of the disease ==\nVarious methods are applied.\n\nThe most effective method is to plant peach trees against a house wall under an overhanging roof, possibly covered by a mat during the winter, to keep winter rain from the buds before they burst (and incidentally to delay blossoming until spring frosts are over), until the temperature exceeds 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in the spring, deactivating the fungus.\nCommercially, spraying the leaves with fungicides is the most common control method. The toxicity of these fungicides means they are not legally available to noncommercial growers in some countries. Spraying should be done in the winter well before budding. If trees are not sprayed early enough, treatment is ineffective. Copper-based mixtures (such as Bordeaux mixture) and lime sulphur are two fungicides commonly used.\nPeach cultivars can be planted which show some resistance to peach leaf curl, or at least regenerate rapidly, such as the white-fleshed Peach 'Benedicte'. For nectarines, the cultivar Kreibich is reported to have some resistance.If a tree has peach leaf curl in a particular year, the disease will inexorably take its course, but measures can be taken to sustain the tree or maximize crop yield: protecting the tree from further rain at temperatures below 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F), applying greasebands around the trunk to protect from insect infestation spreading the disease; providing nitrogen and excess water to minimize stress on the tree; and thinning the fruit. It is unclear whether removal of infected leaves from the tree is beneficial. Removing the infected leaves and fruit after they fall to the ground is sometimes also suggested but superfluous if, in the following winter, fungicides or rain protection are applied.\n\n\n== History ==\nPeach leaf curl was first introduced in America in 1852 and has now spread all over the country. By 1947, the disease was costing the United States $2.5 to 3.0 million annually.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIndex Fungorum\nUSDA ARS Fungal Database\nRoyal Horticultural Society - Peach Leaf Curl\nTreatment of peach leaf curl"

"Ordinariate_for_the_Faithful_of_Eastern_Rite_in_Spain| Ordinariates for Eastern Catholic faithful| Eastern Catholicism in Spain| Catholic Church in Spain| Roman Catholic dioceses in Spain| Eastern Catholic dioceses| Eastern Catholic dioceses in Europe| ","The Ordinariate for the Faithful of Eastern Rite in Spain is an Ordinariate (pseudo-diocese) for all non-Latin Catholic faithful living in Spain who belong to the particular Churches sui iuris of any Eastern rite immediately subject to the Holy See.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was erected on 9 June 2016 by Pope Francis, who also named the current Archbishop of Madrid, Carlos Osoro Sierra, as its first Ordinary.Its creation was a response to the increase of Eastern Catholics in Spanish territory, until then spiritually assisted by the various local dioceses. The Spanish Episcopal Conference already had a pastoral care department for the faithful of oriental rites, who in 2003 drew up the document Orientations for the pastoral care of Eastern Catholics in Spain.The Ordinariate has jurisdiction over all the Catholic faithful of the Eastern rite who live in Spain and may appoint vicars general, having appointed the presbyter Andr\u00e9s Mart\u00ednez Esteban for that position. Like the Ordinariate for Eastern Catholics in France, the ordinary has a personal jurisdiction over the Eastern faithful that is cumulative with the diocesan bishops, from whom he must obtain consent for the decisions that pertain to their respective dioceses, and that retain secondary jurisdiction in minor matters (unlike other oriental ordinariates in what the ordinary has full jurisdiction). It must also require the consent of the primate and synods of the Eastern Churches in the decisions that involve them and obtain from them the clergy of the Ordinariate.Between May 2 and 4, 2017 the ordinary met with the priests of the 3 oriental rites present in Spain to advance in the constitution of the Ordinariate.\n\n\n== Territory ==\nThe Ordinariate has jurisdiction over the Catholic faithful of all Eastern rites living in Spain. Its seat is the city of Madrid.\n\n\n=== Eastern Catholic communities in Spain ===\nEastern Catholics in Spain are mainly from the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church and from the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, both of Byzantine rite. There are also communities of the Syro Malabar Catholic Church. A small Coptic Catholic community that existed in Spain no longer existed at the time of the erection of the Ordinariate, as its faithful migrated to other European countries.\n\n\n==== Romanian Greek-Catholic Church ====\nOn March 16, 2009 the Cardinal and Archbishop of Madrid Antonio Maria Rouco Varela appointed the priest Bogdan Vasile Buda as chaplain responsible for the Romanian community of Byzantine rite residing in the archdiocese of Madrid. In April 2009 he assigned a chapel of the parish of Our Lady of Sorrows in Madrid for the pastoral care of the Romanian faithful of the Byzantine rite of his archdiocese. The community is called Capelania Greco-Catolic\u0103 din Madrid Botezul Domnului (Baptism of the Lord). On March 1, 2012 Bogdan Vasile Buda was named archpriest (protopop) by the Cardinal Primate of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, Lucian Mure\u015fan, and by the archiepiscopal major synod, becoming the national leader of the Romanian Greek Catholic faithful and priests of Spain (Greco-Romanian Catholic Deanery (arciprestazgo) of Madrid).The archpriest has 8 priests serving two parishes and 6 chaplaincies:\nDiocese of Orihuela-Alicante: the chaplaincy is in the church of San Roque in Alicante, with masses once a month in the church of San Pedro and San Pablo de Torrevieja\nDiocese of Almer\u00eda: chaplaincy in the church of the Holy Family of Almer\u00eda (Sf\u00e2nta Familie)\nDiocese of Ciudad Real: in the church of the Remedios of Ciudad Real\nArchdiocese of Granada: existing since 2006, the priest serves in the communities of Castell de Ferro (parish church Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen), Motril (in the church of Carmen) and Granada (in the Virgen del Carmen church, which has a pastoral with gypsies)\nDiocese of Mallorca: a community in the Oratory of San Telm in Palma de Mallorca\n\nDiocese of Calahorra and La Calzada-Logro\u00f1o: Romanian Greek Catholic parish of San Nicol\u00e1s in Calahorra (Parohia Greco-Catolic\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103 Sf\u00e2ntul Nicolae)\nDiocese of Le\u00f3n: the Romanian Greek Catholic parish of Le\u00f3n (Pogor\u00e2rea Sf\u00e2ntului Spirit, in the church of the Railway Orphans of Le\u00f3n and in the chapel of Caritas Diocesana de Benavente).Minor communities without a resident priest exist in the dioceses of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Getafe and Zamora.\n\n\n==== Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church ====\nUkrainian Greek Catholic communities have two parishes (Barcelona and Huelva) and 23 priests in 14 Spanish dioceses:\nDiocese of Albacete\nDiocese of Almer\u00eda: community of Campohermoso\nArchdiocese of Barcelona: personal parish of Sant Josep, Santa M\u00f2nica and Sant Josafat\nDiocese of C\u00e1diz and Ceuta\nDiocese of Cartagena: community of Murcia\nDiocese of C\u00f3rdoba\nDiocese of Cuenca\nDiocese of Gerona\nArchdiocese of Granada: in the parish of Santo \u00c1ngel Custodio\nDiocese of Huelva: have since 2015 in the parish of Saints Cyril and Methodius its own temple on which depends the community of Seville (also with its own temple, the church of the Sisters of Mary Repairing)\nDiocese of Lleida\nArchdiocese of Madrid: Ukrainian chaplaincy with headquarters in the parish of Our Lady of Good Success with 2000 parishioners, on which the chaplaincies depend in the parishes of Santa Teresa de Jesus de Getafe and Virgen de Bel\u00e9n de Alcal\u00e1 de Henares\nDiocese of M\u00e1laga\nDiocese of Mallorca: Ukrainian chaplaincy in the church of Santa Fe in Palma de Mallorca\nDiocese of Orihuela-Alicante: community in Torrevieja\nArchdiocese of Pamplona\nDiocese of Solsona\nArchdiocese of Tarragona\nDiocese of Urgell\nArchdiocese of Valencia\nDiocese of Vic: communities in Torell\u00f3 and in Vic\nDiocese of Vitoria\nArchdiocese of ZaragozaBishop Hlib Lonchyna was apostolic visitor for Ukrainian Greek Catholics in Spain from March 4, 2004 until January 7, 2009. He was succeeded since January 19, 2009 by the titular bishop of Egnazia, Dionisio Lachovicz, as apostolic visitor in Italy and Spain, appointed by Pope Benedict XVI and based in Rome. In 2009 it was estimated that in Spain there were 42,000 faithful in 45 communities of Ukrainians of Byzantine rite, attended by 17 priests.\n\n\n==== Syro-Malabar Catholic Church ====\nIn Madrid there is the Syro Malabar community of Saint Thomas, with 80 members and a priest since 2009, and four other communities in Barcelona, Granada, Toledo and Valladolid, which together another 120 worshipers, ten priests and four nuns.\n\n\n== Ordinaries ==\nCarlos Osoro Sierra (since 2016.06.09)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGcatholic.org\nCatholic-hierarchy"

He was the uncle of Rasse of Gavre, 1st Marquess of Ayseau.\nIn 1601 he received from Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor the hereditary title of Prince de Ligne.\nAs a diplomat, the first Prince de Ligne was involved in many historic events of his time. He represented Archduke Albert of Austria and Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain at the French court of Henri IV of France, in Spain and again in Paris, to congratulate King Louis XIII of France with his marriage with the daughter of Philip III of Spain. During this mission, he discussed several issues with the French political leaders.\nIn 1621 Prince Lamoral I was made grandee of Spain by King Philip IV of Spain for his services rendered to the Crown.

"Festucalex_cinctus| IUCN Red List least concern species| Festucalex| Marine fish| Fish described in 1882| ","Festucalex cinctus (girdled pipefish or orange-cheek pipefish) is a species of marine fish of the pipefish family Syngnathidae which is endemic to the waters off eastern Australia.\n\n\n== Identifying features ==\nThis species can be recognized by its broad head, slender snout, and leafy appendages on its dorsal ridges. Its colour varies from dark grey to orange-brown with pale bars along the back and an orange blotch on the lower gill cover, with occasional sightings of pale or black individuals. It can grow to lengths of 16 centimetres (6.3 in).\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nFestucalex cinctus is endemic to Australia, found off the coast of Queensland and New South Wales. It is a secretive species which lives in sheltered coastal bays and estuaries, on patches of coral rubble, sand or in areas where there is a sparse growth of seagrass, algae and sponges, at depths of 8\u201331 metres (26\u2013102 ft). F. cinctus has been recorded in small numbers in the open water near to pilings of piers in harbours.\n\n\n== Biology ==\nFestucalex cinctus is demersal and is expected to feed on small crustaceans, similar to other pipefish. This species is ovoviviparous, with males carrying eggs and giving birth to live young. The males bear the fertilised eggs in a semi-enclosed pouch on the ventral side of the trunk, this pouch has distinct protective plates and its folds barely meet on the midline when it is full of eggs.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nFestucalex cinctus is a species of marine animal listed under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and which is protected under the New South Wales Fisheries Management Act. Specimens from the tropical part of its distribution, in northern Queensland and the Northern Territory, appear to be different from specimens in New South Wales and may represent a different species.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nFishes of Australia\nGovernment of Australia Department of the Environment and Energy"

"Paint| Paints| Painting materials| Coatings| ","Paint is any pigmented liquid, liquefiable, or solid mastic composition that, after application to a substrate in a thin layer, converts to a solid film. It is most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture. Paint can be made or purchased in many colors\u2014and in many different types. Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but most types dry into a solid. Most paints are either oil-based or water-based and each has distinct characteristics. For one, it is illegal in most municipalities to discard oil-based paint down household drains or sewers. Clean-up solvents are also different for water-based paint than they are for oil-based paint. Water-based paints and oil-based paints will cure differently based on the outside ambient temperature of the object being painted (such as a house.) Usually, the object being painted must be over 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F), although some manufacturers of external paints/primers claim they can be applied when temperatures are as low as 2 \u00b0C (35 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPaint was one of the earliest arts of humanity. Some cave paintings drawn with red or yellow ochre, hematite, manganese oxide, and charcoal may have been made by early Homo sapiens as long as 40,000 years ago. Paint may be even older. In 2003 and 2004, South African archeologists reported finds in Blombos Cave of a 100,000-year-old human-made ochre-based mixture that could have been used like paint. Further excavation in the same cave resulted in the 2011 report of a complete toolkit for grinding pigments and making a primitive paint-like substance.Interior walls at the 5,000-year-old Ness of Brodgar have been found to incorporate individual stones painted in yellows, reds, and oranges, using ochre pigment made of haematite mixed with animal fat, milk or eggs.Ancient colored walls at Dendera, Egypt, which were exposed for years to the elements, still possess their brilliant color, as vivid as when they were painted about 2,000 years ago. The Egyptians mixed their colors with a gummy substance and applied them separately from each other without any blending or mixture. They appear to have used six colors: white, black, blue, red, yellow, and green. They first covered the area entirely with white, then traced the design in black, leaving out the lights of the ground color. They used minium for red, generally of a dark tinge.\nThe oldest known oil paintings are Buddhist murals created circa 650 AD. The works are located in cave-like rooms carved from the cliffs of Afghanistan's Bamiyan Valley, \"

His widespread activity in the region made him an influential figure in New England and Boston classical music, especially choral music, in the latter half of the 19th century. He was especially successful in the presentation of the great oratorios and the management of large choruses.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe began the study of music in Rostock at the age of twelve years, and completed his education in Hanover and Berlin. The revolutions of 1848 motivated him to leave Europe, and with 25 others he organized The Germania Musical Society and went to the United States, giving concerts in London on the way. Zerrahn played first flute. The group reached New York City in September 1848 and gave successful concerts in New York and Brooklyn which were followed by others in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, and New England. They appeared for five or six years with Jenny Lind, Henriette Sontag, Ole Bull, Sigismund Thalberg, Alfred Ja\u00ebll, Camilla Urso, and other artists, disbanding in 1854 after giving 800 concerts during its career.\n\nZerrahn settled in Boston at the conclusion of the tour. From 1855 until 1863 he conducted a Boston \u201cPhilharmonic,\u201d one of several orchestras going by that name at that time.  Beginning in 1865, he led concerts for the Harvard Musical Association until the concerts were discontinued in 1882.  He conducted the Handel and Haydn Society 1854-1895, and he directed the Worcester Music Festival in Massachusetts for thirty years as well, 1866-1897. He was elected conductor of the Oratorio Society of Salem, Massachusetts in 1868, and conducted choral societies in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, Ogdensburg, New York, and other places.\nHe directed the choral forces for Patrick Gilmore's  National Peace Jubilee of 1869 and the World's Peace Jubilee and International Musical Festival of 1872. In 1869, this amounted to a chorus of 10,000; in 1872 the chorus was twice that size though in the latter case the results were not entirely satisfactory. He taught singing, harmony and composition at the New England Conservatory of Music until 1898, when he retired.Among the journals he edited were The Index, The Apograph, The Atlas, and Carl Zerrahn's Selections.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nHoward, John Tasker (1939).

"Hemicontinuity| Mathematical analysis| Continuous mappings| Variational analysis| ","In mathematics, the notion of the continuity of functions is not immediately extensible to multivalued mappings or correspondences between two sets A and B. \nThe dual concepts of upper hemicontinuity and lower hemicontinuity facilitate such an extension. \nA correspondence that has both properties is said to be continuous in an analogy to the property of the same name for functions.\nRoughly speaking, a function is upper hemicontinuous when (1) a convergent sequence of points in the domain maps to a sequence of sets in the range which (2) contain another convergent sequence, then the image of the limiting point in the domain must contain the limit of the sequence in the range. \nLower hemicontinuity

But this should be taken with appropriate care since, for example, there exists a pair of lower hemicontinuous correspondences whose intersection is not lower hemicontinuous. \nThis can be fixed upon strengthening continuity properties: if one of those lower hemicontinuous multifunctions has open graph then their intersection is again lower hemicontinuous.\nCrucial to set-valued analysis (in view of applications) are the investigation of single-valued selections and approximations to multivalued maps. \nTypically lower hemicontinuous correspondences admit single-valued selections (Michael selection theorem, Bressan\u2013Colombo directionally continuous selection theorem, Fryszkowski decomposable map selection). \nLikewise, upper hemicontinuous maps admit approximations (e.g. Ancel\u2013Granas\u2013G\u00f3rniewicz\u2013Kryszewski theorem).\n\n\n== Implications for continuity ==\nIf a correspondence is both upper hemicontinuous and lower hemicontinuous, it is said to be continuous. \nA continuous function is in all cases both upper and lower hemicontinuous.\n\n\n== Other concepts of continuity ==\nThe upper and lower hemicontinuity might be viewed as usual continuity:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u0393\n        :\n        A\n        \u2192\n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Gamma :A\\to B}\n   is lower [resp. upper] hemicontinuous if and only if the mapping \n  \n    \n      \n        \u0393\n        :\n        A\n        \u2192\n        P\n        (\n        B\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Gamma :A\\to P(B)}\n   is continuous where the hyperspace P(B) has been endowed with the lower [resp. upper] Vietoris topology.(For the notion of hyperspace compare also power set and function space).\nUsing lower and upper Hausdorff uniformity we can also define the so-called upper and lower semicontinuous maps in the sense of Hausdorff (also known as metrically lower / upper semicontinuous maps).\n\n\n== See also ==\nDifferential inclusion\nHausdorff distance\nMultivalued function \u2013 Generalization of a function that may produce several outputs for each input\nSemicontinuity\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAliprantis, Charalambos D.; Border, Kim C.

Under the direction of Thomas M. Owen its founder, the agency received state funding by an act of the Alabama Legislature on February 27, 1901. Its primary mission is the collecting and preserving of archives, documents and artifacts relating to the history of the state.  It was the first publicly funded, independent state archives agency in the United States.  It subsequently became a model for the establishment of archives in other states.  Today the agency identifies, preserves, and makes accessible records and artifacts significant to the history of the state and serves as the official repository for records created by Alabama's state agencies.\n\n\n== The building and exhibits ==\nThe Department of Archives and History was housed in the old Senate cloak room at the Alabama State Capitol after its establishment in 1901.  It was then moved to the Capitol's new south wing upon its completion in 1906.  A separate building was first conceived of in 1918 by Thomas McAdory Owen, the first director of the Archives.  However, funding did not become available until the 1930s, when the next director, Marie Bankhead Owen (wife of Thomas), was able to secure the necessary capital from the Works Progress Administration.The three-story Neoclassical building was built from 1938\u201340.  An east wing was completed in 1970 and a west one in 2005.  The west wing added 60,000 square feet (5,574 m2) of new space to the building.  The original Washington Avenue bronze entrance doors to the building were designed by artist Nathan Glick.  They depict eight scenes from Alabama history.  Following many years of wear they were relocated to the Ocllo S. Malone Lobby in the new west wing.  The first and second floors of the Archives building feature walls clad in white Alabama marble.The first floor contains the original Washington Avenue entrance lobby, which features a coffered ceiling with gilt moldings and ceiling medallions.  Other features of the first floor are the Statuary Hall, the Research Room, several auditoriums, a gift shop, and the Ocllo Malone Lobby.\n\n\n=== Museum of Alabama ===\nThe second and third floors contain the Museum of Alabama.  Portraits of people who contributed to the history of the state are hung in various locations on both of these floors.  The second floor contains exhibits featuring the Selma to Montgomery marches, the history of Native Americans in the state from the Pre-Columbian era to the Indian removal, and the history of warfare involving Alabamians from the French Colonial period to the Vietnam War.  The Alabama Sampler Gallery contains Alabama-related artifacts ranging from 19th century clothing to a guitar owned by Hank Williams.  The Hands-On Gallery contains history-related activities for children.  The third floor houses paintings and sculpture.\n\n\n== Directors ==\nThe department has had six directors since its inception.  Thomas McAdory Owen served from 1901 until his death in 1920.  He was succeeded by Marie Bankhead Owen, his wife, who served until her retirement in 1955.  Peter A. Brannon was director from 1955 to 1967, followed by Milo Howard.  Howard served until Edwin Bridges took over in 1982.  Bridges served until his retirement in 2012.

"Giovanni_Dandolo| 1289 deaths| House of Dandolo| 13th-century Doges of Venice| ","Giovanni Dandolo was the 48th Doge of Venice, elected late in his life on 31 March 1280, died on 2 November 1289. During his reign the first Venetian gold ducat was introduced into circulation.\n\n\n== Family ==\nDandolo came from a prominent Venetian family that provided three other doges to Venice: Enrico Dandolo, Francesco Dandolo and Andrea Dandolo. Two women from the Dandolo family married doges:  Giovanna Dandolo with Pasquale Malipiero and Zilia Dandolo with Lorenzo Priuli.\nDandolo is a distant relative of many famous figures in Italian history, such as Fra Angelico, Eugenio Canfari, Benito Mussolini. \nBut belonging to the branch of the parish of S. Mois\u00e8, he was the son of Giberto who had defeated the Genoese in the battle near Settepozzi, and of Maria of Gratone Dandolo of S. Polo. According to all the oldest genealogies his grandfather was called Giacomo: it is therefore to be considered a mistake of the most recent literature the attribution to him of the vicedoge Raniero as an ancestor and then of the Doge Enrico as great-grandfather.Giovanni Dandolo was married to some one named Caterina.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBefore his election as doge, Dandolo occupied various public positions including Podest\u00e0 of Bologna and Padua, and commander of the Venetian naval units. The news of his election to doge reached him while he was fighting in a military action against Istria and Trieste, which expanded into an open war in the following year, also involving Venice's perennial enemy, the Patriarchate of Aquileia and the Papal States. More armed clashes followed, and continued for the duration of Dandolo's reign as doge.\nAfter Dandolo signed the peace Treaty of Ravenna with Ancona, a new military theater opened through the revolt in Crete led by the Greek noble Alexios Kallergis and backed by the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII, Venice's rival for the domination of the eastern Mediterranean. These conflicts forced the Republic of Venice to negotiate peace agreements with Charles of Anjou and Philip III of France, concluding an alliance with the former in the Treaty of Orvieto.\nDuring Dandolo's reign as doge, relations with the Vatican were tense.  Venice had refused to join the Papal States in a punitive action against Sicily, provoking Pope Martin IV to excommunicate Venice, which was later repealed in 1285 by Martin's successor, Pope Honorius IV. In 1287 unrest flared up again in Istria and spread to Friuli. The war widened after the intervention of the German Emperor Rudolf I, who was allied with the Patriarchate of Aquileia, and Venice had to sue for peace.\n\nIn 1284, the first Venetian gold ducat, later called the Zecchino, was introduced into circulation. The ducat would be used until the end of the Venetian Republic and was always made with the same weight, 3.56 grams of 24 karat (99.7%) gold.  The coin was valid in all states with which Venice traded. The name ducat comes from the inscription on the coin's back:  Sit tibi Christe datus quem tu regis iste ducatus, which frames a picture of Christ. The front of each coin showed the ruling doges on their knees in front of the city's patron saint, Mark the Evangelist.\nDandolo was buried in San Zanipolo. The tomb was not preserved, only a stone slab with an inscription commemorates the doge.\n\n\n== References ==\nHelmut Dumler: Venedig und die Dogen. D\u00fcsseldorf 2001."

He was an important figure in the early history of the movement but later fell out of favour.\n\n\n== Falangism ==\nD\u00e1vila was a cousin of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera and as such was given the responsibility of expanding the operations of the Falange in Seville and C\u00e1diz in 1933. He soon rose to the rank of jefe territorial for Andalusia. He was a close ally of Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1inz Nothnagel and was arrested with him in May 1936 at Jos\u00e9 Antonio's house.\n\n\n== Power struggle ==\nFollowing the execution of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, D\u00e1vila joined with his ally Agust\u00edn Aznar in a power struggle for the leadership of the Falange. The two men led the legitimistas group within the movement which opposed the leadership of Primo de Rivera's nominated successor Manuel Hedilla. D\u00e1vila's presence was especially important to this group due to his familial connection and he was central in maintaining the cult of El Ausente (the absent), as Primo de Rivera was to be known. In the struggle that followed the legitimista militia seized power for themselves and on April 16, 1937 set up a triumvirate made up of  D\u00e1vila, Aznar and Jos\u00e9 Moreno at the head of the Falange. However, with the help of nazi German agent Carl von Haartman, Hedilla's forces recaptured the Falange HQ from D\u00e1vila and before long Francisco Franco stepped in, ostensibly to support Hedilla but in fact to create the Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista and thus effectively eliminate the Falange and its leaders as threats to his position. D\u00e1vila was imprisoned following the incident although his close friend Gonzalo Queipo de Llano intervened to secure his release.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nIn a snub from Franco, he was not named as a National Delegate until 1938 at a time when a number of pro-Nazis were added to this office. He was replaced as delegate to the Frente de Juventudes in 1941 by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Elola-Olaso as the influence of D\u00e1vila's ally Ram\u00f3n Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er began to wane.Between 1952 and 1954 he served as the President of the Royal Spanish Football Federation.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Sancho D\u00e1vila y Fern\u00e1ndez de Celis at Wikimedia Commons"

"Small_nucleolar_RNA_SNORD64| Small nuclear RNA| Molecular and cellular biology stubs| ","In molecular biology, SNORD64 (also known as HBII-13)  is a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecule which functions in the biogenesis (modification) of other small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). This type of modifying RNA is located in the nucleolus of the eukaryotic cell which is a major site of snRNA biogenesis. It is known as a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and also often referred to as a guide RNA.\nSNORD64 belongs to the C/D box class of snoRNAs which contain the conserved sequence motifs known as the C box (UGAUGA) and the D box (CUGA). Most of the members of the box C/D family function in directing site-specific 2'-O-methylation of substrate RNAs.snoRNA HBII-13 is expressed mainly in the tissues of brain, but is also in the lungs, the kidneys and muscle; however HBII-13 has no identified target RNA.\nThe HBII-13 gene is located in a 460 kb intron of the large paternally-expressed transcription unit (SNURF-SNRNP-UBE3A AS) along with several other snoRNAs HBII-436, HBII-437, HBII-438A/B and the clusters of HBII-85, HBII-52.

It had an estimated moment magnitude of 7.1\u20137.2 and a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe). The shock was centered near the Mexico\u2013United States border and takes its name from a large dry lake bed in Baja California, Mexico. There were no reported casualties, but the event affected the then largely-uninhabited areas of northern Mexico and Southern California.\n\n\n== Tectonic setting ==\n\nThe Salton Trough is part of the complex plate boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate where it undergoes a transition from the continental transform of the San Andreas Fault system to the series of short spreading centers of the East Pacific Rise linked by oceanic transforms in the Gulf of California. The southern part of the trough is divided into two by the Sierra Cucapa and Sierra Mayor ranges forming the Mexicali Valley to the east and the Laguna Salada to the west. The western side of these ranges is formed by the Laguna Salada Fault, which forms a possible continuation of the Elsinore Fault Zone of southern California.\nThe Laguna Salada Fault shows combined normal (down to the southwest) and dextral (right-lateral) movement. Prior to 2010 it showed evidence of recent (probably historical) displacement with a 22 km (14 mi) zone of surface faulting, and 3\u20134 m (9.8\u201313.1 ft) of vertical displacement. This is interpreted to be associated with the 1892 earthquake.\n\n\n== Earthquake ==\nThe earthquake was felt over a wide area from Los Angeles and San Bernardino in the north to San Quintin in the south. The area in which the perceived intensity of shaking reached VIII (Severe) or more was centered on the mapped fault rupture.\n\n\n=== Damage ===\nA report from the Los Angeles Times the following day stated no damage was found in Los Angeles, but also specified that severe shocks were felt in San Diego. Masonry walls were cracked in several buildings there, as well as the outlying communities of Otay and Jamul. At the abandoned Carrizo Creek Stage Station, in what is now Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in eastern San Diego county, poorly built masonry was damaged and all adobe buildings were destroyed. At Hook Ranch and Laguna Station the shaking was strong enough to throw people off their feet and at Dulzura Canyon and McCain Valley the ground was seen to move in waves. There were rockfalls at Bratton Valley, Tierra Blanca Canyon, Storm Canyon and Whale Peak and landslides at Dulzura Canyon and Devil's Canyon.\n\n\n=== Aftershocks ===\nAt Campo, California 155 aftershocks were felt in the first 12 hours after the mainshock and continued every few days for the next two months.\n\n\n== Other events ==\nThe Laguna Salada fault moved again during the 2010 Baja California earthquake.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of earthquakes in California\nList of earthquakes in the United States\nList of historical earthquakes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRupture Pattern of the 1892 Laguna Salada Earthquake: A Precursor to 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah \u2013 Southern California Earthquake Center"

"Kalam_language| Languages of Papua New Guinea| Kalam languages| Pandanus avoidance registers| ","Kalam is a Kalam language of Papua New Guinea. It is closely related to Kobon, and shares many of the features of that language.

"Sighthill,_Glasgow| Areas of Glasgow| Housing estates in Glasgow| Springburn| ","Sighthill is a neighbourhood in the Scottish city of Glasgow. It is situated north of the River Clyde and is part of the wider Springburn district in the north of the city. It is bordered to the north by Cowlairs, to the east by the Springburn Bypass road and the Royston neighbourhood, to the west by the Glasgow to Edinburgh via Falkirk Line (running into Queen Street Station) and to the south by the Townhead interchange of the M8 Motorway.\nThe district is primarily residential and from the mid-1960s consisted of a housing estate split into two sub-areas \u2013  Pinkston to the south and Fountainwell to the north \u2013 each with five 20-storey 'slab' tower blocks, plus seven 5-storey maisonette blocks and five rows of tenements in between. Most of these buildings were demolished in stages during the early 21st century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSighthill formed part of the Springburn Comprehensive Development Area (CDA), and was one of the 20 CDA's around the city where slum housing was completely demolished and replaced by new concrete housing estates based on contemporary architectural practices.  Designed by Crudens Ltd, the housing scheme was built by Glasgow Corporation Housing Department between 1964 and 1969 as part of the city's housing replacement programme \u2013 the existing housing in the area itself, consisting of tenements on Springburn Road and just off it at Huntingdon Place, was demolished in the process. Much of the land used for the Pinkston sector was known as the 'Soda Waste', derelict ground on which the United Alkali Company's St. Rollox Chemical Works, founded by Charles Tennant and at one time the largest chemical manufacturer in the world, used to dump waste chemicals (particularly hydrogen sulfide, a byproduct of the Leblanc process) until its closure in 1964. The Chemical Works was located on the north bank of the Monkland Canal, immediately east of Port Dundas. The Fountainwell sector was built on a farm of the same name, to the south of Sighthill Cemetery which opened in 1840. Within it stands the memorial to John Baird and Andrew Hardie, the leaders of the 1820 Radical War otherwise known as the 1820 Insurrection. William Mossman and his sculptor sons are buried here.\nThe Pinkston power station, which had supplied power to the city's tram system and the Subway, was closed in 1975, and its signature cooling tower which dominated the city's skyline was demolished in 1977, with the rest of the complex being removed the year after.\nThe Sighthill estate later suffered from stigma, as high-rise living went out of fashion. It suffered from low demand since the mid-1970s, despite its proximity to the city centre. Because of its low occupancy rate, Sighthill (along with nearby Red Road) was selected in the late 1990s as a temporary housing location for refugees and asylum seekers. As a result, the neighbourhood had one of the most diverse ethnic makeups in Scotland.\nIn 2005, letting was suspended in the Fountainwell side of Sighthill as new landlords, Glasgow Housing Association considered the estate's future. The decision was eventually made that Fountainwell should be demolished. The first two blocks were demolished in July 2008 with the three remaining blocks following in November 2009. Sighthill Primary School was also demolished after the tower blocks due to an arson attack shortly after it closed.\nThe fate of the five remaining Pinkston blocks was debated further. After a campaign by local residents, at least two of the blocks were to be retained and refurbished by Glasgow Housing Association, with three being demolished or sold to private developers. However, Glasgow then bid for the 2018 Youth Olympics and were added to the hosting shortlist, but the successful city had to have its Athletes Village prepared \u2013  this resulted in the total demolition of Sighthill's towers to accommodate a new low-rise revelopment. The bid was lost, but regeneration continued. The Sighthill 'Transformational Regeneration Area' includes a new school campus, landscaped green areas, enhanced pedestrian bridge to the city centre and better connectivity to the Forth and Clyde Canal, in addition to approximately 1,000 new housing units for sale, private rental and social rental (much of it marketed as 'NorthBridge' by developers Keepmoat).There is also an active Community Council consisting of several committed residents who aim to deal with issues affecting the Sighthill neighbourhood.\n\n\n== Sighthill stone circle ==\nSighthill hosts the first astronomically aligned stone circle built in Great Britain for 3,000 years, guided by Duncan Lunan. Built at the highest point of Sighthill Park, the stone circle has a vantage point over the surrounding areas. There are 17 stones in the circle \u2013 with 16 forming a circle 30 feet (9 metres) across, and the largest four-tonne stone in the centre. The Sighthill megalith was intended as a tribute to both the ancient megalith builders and the scientists who discovered their significance. It was renovated in the late 2010s along with the rest of the district.\n\n\n== Tower blocks ==\nEach block contained 228 flats (i.e. 2,280 residences in total across the 10 blocks); essentially each block was two towers, each with 19 habitable floors of six flats in a mirror-image of the other and a separate communal entrance, joined together at a central wall. They were 57.6 metres (189 ft) tall.\n\n\n=== Fountainwell ===\nIn order of Demolition\n\nEagle Heights (2-4 Fountainwell Place) Cruden 1 (demolished: 13 July 2008)\nBarony Heights (16-18 Fountainwell Place) Cruden 2 (demolished: 13 July 2008)\nTennant Heights (37-49 Fountainwell Avenue) Cruden 3 (demolished: 29 November 2009)\nPhoenix Heights (6-8 Fountainwell Square) Cruden 5 (demolished: 29 November 2009)\nSt. Rollox Heights (2-4 Fountainwell Terrace) Cruden 4 (demolished: 29 November 2009)\n\n\n=== Pinkston ===\nParson Heights (16-18 Pinkston Drive) (demolished June 2013)\nHuntingdon Heights (17-19 Pinkston Drive) (demolished September/October 2013)\nPinkston Heights (3-5 Pinkston Drive) (demolished April 2014)\nCrawfurd Heights (31-35 Pinkston Drive) (demolished March\u2013June 2016)\nHartfield Heights (32-34 Pinkston Drive) (demolished July\u2013October 2016)\n\n\n== See also ==\nGlasgow tower blocks\nList of tallest voluntarily demolished buildings\nTowers in the park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSighthill Stone Circle\nSighthill Community Council (on Facebook)\nWebsite of St Rollox, the local church\nWebsite of St Mungo, the local chapel\nSpringburn Virtual Museum"

"Internal_erosion| Dams| Erosion| ","Internal erosion is the formation of voids within a soil caused by the removal of material by seepage. It is the second most common cause of failure in levees and one of the leading causes of failures in earth dams, responsible for about half of embankment dam failures.Internal erosion occurs when the hydraulic forces exerted by water seeping through the pores and cracks of the material in the dam and/or foundation are sufficient to detach particles and transport them out of the dam structure.\nInternal erosion is especially dangerous because there may be no external evidence, or only subtle evidence, that it is taking place. Usually a sand boil can be found, but the boil might be hidden under water. A dam may breach within a few hours after evidence of internal erosion becomes obvious.\nPiping is a related phenomenon and is defined as the progressive development of internal erosion by seepage, appearing downstream as a hole discharging water.  Piping is induced by regressive erosion of particles from downstream and along the upstream line towards an outside environment until a continuous pipe is formed.\n\n\n== Internal erosion and the piping process ==\nAccording to the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD), there are four general failure modes for internal erosion of embankment dams and their foundations:\nThrough the embankment\nThrough the foundation\nEmbankment-into-foundation\nAssociated with through-penetrating structuresThe process of internal erosion occurs across four phases: initiation of erosion, progression to form a pipe, surface instability, and, lastly, initiation of a breach.  Internal erosion is also classified in four types, dependent on failure path, how the erosion initiates and progresses, and its location:\n\nConcentrated leak: seeping water erodes and enlarges a crack until a breach occurs.  The crack may not progress to the exit (albeit failure is still possible), but eventually the continued erosion forms a pipe or a sinkhole.\nBackward erosion: initiated at the exit point of the seepage path, this type of erosion occurs when the hydraulic gradient is sufficiently high to cause particle detachment and transport; a pipe forms backwards from the exit point until breach.\nSuffusion: occurs in soils with a wide range of particle sizes.  Finer soil particles are eroded through the voids between coarser particles.  Soils susceptible to suffusion are termed internally unstable.  Suffusion can only occur if the volume occupied by the finer particles is lower than the available void space between the coarse particles.\nSoil contact erosion: a phenomenon called sheet flow occurs at interfaces between coarse and fine soils.  Water seeps along the interface between the two soils, eroding the particles from the finer layer into the coarser layer.\n\n\n=== Concentrated leak ===\nConcentrated leaks occur when cracks form in the soil.  The cracks must be below reservoir level, and water pressure needs to be present to maintain the open pipe.  It is possible for water flow to cause the sides of the pipe to swell, closing it and thus limiting erosion.  Additionally, if the soil lacks sufficient cohesion to maintain a crack, the crack will collapse and concentrated leak erosion will not progress to a breach.  Cracks that allow concentrated leaks can arise due to many factors, including:\n\nCross-valley arching resulting in vertical stresses on the sides of the dam\nCore arching on the shoulders of the embankment\nDifferential settlement (above 0.2% differential, a crack forming is almost certain)\nSmall scale irregularities during core treatment (e.g. due to poor compaction)\nCracks and gaps adjacent to spillways or abutment walls or around conduits\nVarious environmental factors like desiccation, settlement during earthquakes, freezing, animal burrows, vegetation/roots.Longitudinal cracks arise from the spreading of the embankment, while transverse openings, which are much more common, are due to vertical settlement of the dam.  The hydraulic shear stress \u03c4c required for the initiation of concentrated leak erosion can be estimated using laboratory testing, such as the hole erosion test (HET).\n\n\n=== Backward erosion ===\n\nBackward erosion often occurs in non-plastic soils such as fine sands. It can occur in sandy foundations, within the dam or levee, or in cofferdams under high flood pressures during construction, causing unravelling at the downstream face. Backward erosion is most often exhibited by the presence of sand boils at the downstream side of dams. Experiments from Sellmeijer and co-workers have shown that backwards erosion initiates in a slot through the strata that overlays the eroding soil (e.g. through excavations or drainage ditches) and then progress in many, smaller pipes (less than 2mm in height) rather than a single one. The stability of the pipes is dependent on the head, and once this is larger than a critical value (0.3-0.5 of flow path length), the channel extends upstream. Beyond this, at any head greater than the critical value, erosion progresses until eventually the pipes break through to the upstream reservoir, at which point breach occurs. In order for backwards erosion to occur, the dam or levee body must form and maintain a \u2018roof\u2019 for the pipe.\n\n\n=== Suffusion ===\nSuffusion occurs when water flows through widely-graded or gap-graded, cohesionless soils. The finer particles are transported by seepage, and the coarse particles carry most of the effective stress. Suffusion can only occur provided the fine soil particles are small enough to pass between the coarse particles and do not fill the voids in the coarser soil. Water flow velocity must also be sufficient to transport those fine particles.\nSuffusion leads to increased permeability in the embankment core, greater seepage velocities and possibly hydraulic fractures. It can also lead to settlement  if it occurs in the dam foundation. Soils subject to suffusion also tend to be affected by segregation. The Kenney-Lau approach is a renowned method for the analysis of suffusion, which uses the particle size distribution to assess the internal stability of a soil, which directly affects the likelihood of suffusion occurring.\n\n\n=== Soil contact erosion ===\nSoil contact erosion occurs when sheet flow (water flow parallel to an interface) erodes fine soil in contact with coarse soil. Contact erosion is largely dependent on the flow velocity, which must be sufficient to detach and transport the finer particles, as well as the finer soil particles being able to pass through the pores in the coarse layer. When contact erosion is initiated, a cavity is formed, leading to a reduction of stress. The roof of the cavity then collapses; the collapsed material is transported away resulting in a larger cavity. The process continues until the formation of a sinkhole. It is possible for a cavity to not collapse; this will lead to backward erosion occurring.\nSoil contact erosion can occur between any granular layer and a finer soil such as in silt-gravel, and often results in a loss of stability, increases in pore pressure and clogging of the permeable layer. \nExperimental results show that close to the geometrical limit, the point at which the fine particles can just pass between the coarse particles(the filter criterion), erosion initiation and failure are much more likely.\n\n\n== Prevention using filters ==\nIt is possible to interrupt the process of internal erosion with the use of filters. Filters trap eroded particles while still allowing seepage, and are normally coarser and more permeable than the filtered soil. The type of filter required and its location is dependent on which zones of the dam are most susceptible to internal erosion. Per regulation, filters need to satisfy five conditions:\nRetention: the filter must limit or interrupt the transport of eroded soil particles.\nSelf-filtration: also defined as stability, the filter must be internally stable.\nNo cohesion: the filter must not have the ability to maintain cracks or the ability to cement.\nDrainage: the filter must be sufficiently permeable to allow water pressure to dissipate.\nStrength: the filter must be capable of transferring stresses within the dam without being crushed.\n\n\n== References =="

Knopf and starring Greer Garson, Michael Wilding and Fernando Lamas. It is based on the 1925 play The Last of Mrs. Cheyney by Frederick Lonsdale, and was not related to the Wilkie Collins novel The Law and the Lady. Previous film versions of the story had been made in 1929 and 1937.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nJane Hoskins (Garson) has worked most of her life as a lady's maid, and is currently employed by Lord Minden and his haughty wife Lady Sybil Minden. Lord Minden's younger twin brother, The Honourable Nigel Duxbury (Wilding) received only ten thousand pounds to his brother's five million because his brother was born five minutes before him and is therefore seen as being the elder sibling in the eyes of the law. Having squandered his money, Nigel sneaks into his brother's home and steals Lady Minden's earrings. Lady Minden accuses her maid Jane of the theft until Nigel steps forward and claims responsibility. Jane is angry at being wrongly accused of theft by her employer and decides to quit her job and make her way into high society.\nNigel is impressed by Jane's attitude and, after securing the earrings in return for never bothering his brother again, he offers to take Jane out for an evening of fine dining. Together they unintentionally con a wealthy gentleman into believing that Jane is a wealthy widow, the Lady Lovely, and that she collects donations for a fictional Egyptian charity called The Nile Fund. At the end of the night, one hundred pounds wealthier, Jane makes a business arrangement with Nigel that the two of them should work together as confidence tricksters.\nJane and Nigel travel to Monte Carlo, San Remo and Shanghai, where they cheat at gambling and are repeatedly asked by the authorities to leave the country. Eventually they make their way to San Francisco, where Nigel suggests they move into jewellery theft. Nigel gets himself a job as a butler named Hoskins in the house of society queen Julia Wortin (Marjorie Main), and Jane befriends Mrs Wortin and is invited to the house as a guest. The two plan to lift Julia's diamond necklace during their stay.\nJulia throws a party in Jane's honour and her exotic neighbor Juan (Lamas) begins to woo Jane. Jane becomes somewhat swept off her feet at Juan's attentions to her, causing Nigel to become jealous. On the first night of her stay, Jane locates Julia's safe and the necklace, but is touched by the lady's kindness towards her and has second thoughts about their plan, so she does not go through with it. The following day Jane receives a proposal from Juan and decides to accept. Jane and Nigel argue about Jane's decision, and although they share a kiss, they are reluctant to admit their feelings for one another, having long ago agreed that theirs was a strictly business relationship.\nJane decides to steal the necklace and give it to Nigel because she is worried about his future now that she will no longer be his partner in crime. Juan sees her give the necklace to Nigel and has already discovered that she is not really Lady Lovely. Juan and his servant apprehend Nigel, and Juan forces himself into Jane's room, where she activates the burglar alarm. Realising that Juan is not going to give her away, Jane reveals that she is a thief to Julia. Nigel turns up with a letter from one of Julia's other house guests which contains libelous information with which he and Jane can blackmail Julia and her guests if they decide to turn Jane and Nigel over to the police. The guests bid for ownership of the libelous letter, but Jane decides to give it to Juan for free for his kindness. Julia thinks the whole evening has been a bit of excitement and asks Jane and Nigel to stay on.\nThe following morning, after fighting over Jane the night before, Juan and Nigel inform Jane that they have decided Juan should be the one she ends up with. Jane reveals her true love for Nigel by yelling at him for letting her down and revealing that she has always loved him but that he was \"

She is most known for her play By the Pike's Wish (1936).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nYelizaveta Tarakhovskaya (born Parnokh) was born in the city of Taganrog on July 26, 1891 in a pharmacist's family. She is sister to poet Sophia Parnok and twin sister to founder of Soviet Russian jazz Valentin Parnakh. She graduated from the Taganrog Girls Gymnasium, later studied in Bestuzhev courses in Saint Petersburg and started to write poems in her childhood.\n\nIn 1925, her first books were published: On How Chocolate Came to MosSelProm and Tit Will Fly. Since then, she wrote many children's books, including Metropolitan (1932), The Moon and the Lazy Fellow (1933), The Seagull (1965, dedicated to Valentina Tereshkova, Soviet Russian cosmonaut, the first woman to go into space). She is the author of poems for grown-ups: The Violin Clef (1958), The Bird (1965). The verses of Tarakhovskaya are lyrical, thoughtful, and almost always full of humor, with most of them being the poetry of ordinary and everyday things around.\nYelizaveta Tarakhovskaya translated into Russian many poems for children written by various Soviet and foreign authors: verses of Polish poet Julian Tuwim, Uzbek poet Kuddus Muhammadi (Muhammadiev), Azerbaijani poet Mirvari Dilbazi, Georgian poet Mariki Baratashvili(\u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\u10d9\u10d0 \u10d1\u10d0\u10e0\u10d0\u10d7\u10d0\u10e8\u10d5\u10d8\u10da\u10d8), Lithuanian poet Eduardas Mie\u017eelaitis, Bulgarian poet Assen Bossev and many more.\nToday Tarakhovskaya is probably most known for her play By the Pike's Wish, which was staged by Sergey Obraztsov in the Moscow State Academic Puppet Show named after Serguei Obraztsov in November 1936 and has remained in the theater's repertoire ever since. The play By the Pike's Wish (Po shchuchuyemu veleniyu) is considered by theater experts as the greatest puppet show of the 20th century, making quintessence of Meyerhold's methods. It was also released as a motion picture in 1938 (directed by Aleksandr Rou).\nYelizaveta Tarakhovskaya died in Moscow on November 11, 1968 and was buried on Novodevichy Cemetery near her twin-brother Valentin.A memorial plaque dedicated to Parnok family was placed on the wall of their birth house in Taganrog in 2012.\n\n\n== Works (alphabetical list) ==\n\n12 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u043f\u044f\u0442\u0438 /  \u041c.: \u0413\u0438\u0437, 1930.\n\u0411\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043d! / \u041c.: \u041c\u043e\u043b. \u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u044f, 1932.\n\u0411\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043d! / \u041c.: \u0413\u0438\u0437, 1930.\n\u0411\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043d! / \u0418\u0437\u0434. 3-\u0435. \u041c.: \u041c\u043e\u043b. \u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u044f, 1930.\n\u0412\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 / \u041c.; \u041b.: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442, 1937.\n\u0413\u0434\u0435 \u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0445\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430? / \u041c.; \u041b.: \u0413\u0438\u0437, 1930.\n\u0414\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0430 /\u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442: \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u0423\u0437. \u0421\u0421\u0420, 1942.\n\u0416\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430 / \u041c.: \u0413. \u0424. \u041c\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432, 1928.\n\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u0432 \u0441\u0430\u0434 / \u041c.; \u041b.: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0433\u0438\u0437, 1949.\n\u041a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b \u0432 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0435 / \u041c.: \u0413\u0438\u0437, 1930.\n\u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044f, \u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f / \u041b.: \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0433\u0430, 1929.\n\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e / \u041c.: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0433\u0438\u0437, 1951.\n\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e. \u0418\u0437\u0434. 3-\u0435. \u041c.; \u041b.: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442, 1938.\n\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043d / \u041c.: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0433\u0438\u0437, 1935.\n\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043d / \u0418\u0437\u0434. 2-\u0435. \u041c.: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442, 1936.\n\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043d / \u041c.: \u041c\u043e\u043b. \u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u044f, 1932.\n\u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043c / \u0418\u0437\u0434. 2-\u0435. \u041c.; \u041b.: \u041c\u043e\u043b. \u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u044f, 1931.\n\u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043c / 1928.\n\u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043c / \u041c.; \u041b.: \u0413\u0438\u0437, 1930.\n\u041e \u0442\u043e\u043c, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043b \u0448\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0434 \u0432 \u041c\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c /\u0420\u044f\u0437\u0430\u043d\u044c: \u0418\u0437\u0434. \"

"Trifluoromethylation| Organic reactions| ","Trifluoromethylation in organic chemistry describes any organic reaction that introduces a trifluoromethyl group in an organic compound. Trifluoromethylated compounds are of some importance in pharmaceutical industry and agrochemicals. Several notable pharmaceutical compounds have a trifluoromethyl group incorporated: fluoxetine, mefloquine, Leflunomide, nulitamide, dutasteride, bicalutamide, aprepitant, celecoxib, fipronil, fluazinam, penthiopyrad, picoxystrobin, fluridone, norflurazon, sorafenib and triflurazin. A relevant agrochemical is trifluralin. The development of synthetic methods for adding trifluoromethyl groups to chemical compounds is actively pursued in academic research.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first to investigate trifluoromethyl groups in relationship to biological activity was F. Lehmann in 1927. An early review appeared in 1958. An early synthetic method was developed by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Swarts in 1892, based on antimony fluoride. In this reaction benzotrichloride was reacted with SbF3 to form PhCF2Cl and\nPhCF3. In the 1930s Kinetic Chemicals and IG Farben replaced SbF3 with HF.\nThe McLoughlin-Thrower reaction (1968) is an early coupling reaction using iodofluoroalkanes, iodoaromatic compounds and copper. In 1969 Kobayashi & Kumadaki adapted their protocol for trifluoromethylations.\n\n\n== Reagents ==\n\n\n=== Trifluoromethyltrimethylsilane ===\nPreparation of the trifluoromethyltrimethylsilane was reported by Ingo Ruppert in 1984. In 1989, Prakash and Olah first reported activation of TMSCF3 by fluoride to perform nucleophilic trifluoromethylation of carbonyl compounds. In the same year, Stahly described similar reactions for the synthesis of trifluoromethylated phenols and anilines. Since then TMSCF3 has been widely used as a nucleophilic trifluoromethylating agent.An example is the trifluoromethylation of cyclohexanone in THF using tetrabutylammonium fluoride.\nThe substrates can be aryl halides. Potassium (trifluoromethyl)trimethoxyborate for this purpose has been synthesised from B(OMe)3, CF3SiMe3 and KF. Aryl functionalization by C-H activation has also been reported.\n\n\n=== Sodium trifluoroacetate ===\nSodium trifluoroacetate as a reagent for trifluoromethylations was introduced by Matsui in 1981. In the original scope the substrate was an aromatic halide and the metal salt copper(I)iodide.\n\n\n=== Trifluoromethane ===\nFluoroform (CF3H) has been employed as a trifluoromethylation reagent for aldehydes in combination with a strong base\n\n\n=== Trifluoroiodomethane ===\nTrifluoroiodomethane is a reagent in aromatic coupling reactions. It has also been used with enones, for example with chalcone, a reaction catalysed by diethyl zinc and Wilkinson's catalyst:\n\n\n=== Trifluoromethyl sulfone ===\nTrifluoromethyl sulfone (PhSO2CF3) and trifluoromethyl sulfoxide (PhSOCF3) can be used for trifluoromethylations of electrophiles\n\n\n=== Trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride ===\nTrifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride (or triflyl chloride, CF3SO2Cl) can be used in a highly efficient method to introduce a trifluoromethyl group to aromatic and heteroaromatic systems, including known pharmaceuticals such as Lipitor. The chemistry is general and mild, and uses a photoredox catalyst and a light source at room temperature.\n\n\n=== Sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate ===\nSodium trifluoromethanesulfinate (CF3SO2Na) as a trifluoromethylation reagent was introduced by Langlois in 1991. The reaction requires t-butyl hydroperoxide and generally a metal and proceeds through a radical mechanism. The reagent has been applied with heterocyclic substrates\n\n\n=== Umemoto reagents ===\nUmemoto reagents are (trifluoromethyl)dibenzoheterocyclic salts.\n\n\n=== Trifluoromethyl-metal reagents ===\nMany CF3-containing metal complexes have been prepared, and some are useful for trifluoromethylation. The most obvious reagent is CF3Li, which can be generated by lithium-iodide exchange.  This compound is however unstable even at low temperatures.  It degrades to lithium fluoride and difluorocarbene.  Trifluoromethyl copper(I) reagents are more useful.  These reagents are generated in situ by reaction of CF3I with copper powder in polar solvents.   Hg(CF3)2, prepared by decarboxylation of the trifluoroacetate, has proven useful for the trifluoromethylation of other metals.\n\n\n== Reaction types ==\n\n\n=== Aromatic coupling reactions ===\nIn coupling reactions between aromatic compounds and metal-trifluoromethyl complexes the metal is usually copper, Pd and Ni are less prominent. The reactions are stoichiometric or catalytic. In the McLoughlin-Thrower reaction (1962) iodobenzene reacts with trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I) and copper powder  in dimethylformamide at 150 \u00b0C to trifluoromethylbenzene. The intermediate in this reaction type is a perfluoromethyl-metal complex.\nA palladium acetate catalysed reaction described in 1982 used zinc powder with the main intermediate believed to be CF3ZnI with Pd(0) is the active catalyst. The first copper catalysed coupling was reported in 2009 and based on an iodoarene, a trifluoromethylsilane, copper iodide and 1,10-phenanthroline. Variations include another CF3 donor potassium (trifluoromethyl)trimethoxyborate, the use of aryl boronic acids or the use of a trifluoromethyl sulfonium salt or the use of a trifluoromethylcopper(I) phenanthroline complex. A catalytic palladium catalysed reaction was reported in 2010 using aryl halides, (trifluoromethyl)triethylsilane and allylpalladium chloride dimer\n\n\n=== Radical trifluoromethylation ===\nIn radical trifluoromethylation the active species is the trifluoromethyl free radical. Reagents such as bromotrifluoromethane and haloform have been used for this purpose but in response to the Montreal Protocol alternatives such as trifluoroiodomethane have been developed as replacement. One particular combination is CF3I / triethylborane\nOther reagents that generate the CF3 radical are sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate and bis(trifluoroacetyl) peroxide.\n\nIn the CF3 radical the fluorine atom is an electron-withdrawing group via the inductive effect but also a weak pi donor through interaction of the fluorine lone pair with the radical center's SOMO. Compared to the methyl radical the CF3 radical is pyramidal (angle 107.8 \u00b0C ) with a large inversion barrier, electrophilic and also more reactive. In reaction with styrene it is 440 times more reactive. An early report (1949) describes the photochemical reaction of iodotrifluoromethane with ethylene to 3-iodo-1,1,1-trifluoropropane. Reagents that have been reported for the direct trifluoromethylation of arenes are CF3I, CF3Br (thermal or photochemical), silver trifluoroacetate/TiO2 (photochemical) and sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate/Cu(OSO2CF3)2/tBuOOH.\n\n\n=== Nucleophilic trifluoromethylation ===\nIn nucleophilic trifluoromethylation the active species is the CF3\u2212 anion. It was, however, widely believed that the trifluoromethyl anion is a transient species and thus cannot be isolated or observed in the condensed phase.  Contrary to the popular belief, the CF3 anion, with [K(18-crown-6)]+ as a countercation, was produced and characterized by Prakash and coworkers. The challenges associated with observation of CF3 anion are alluded to its strong basic nature and its tendency to form pentacoordinated silicon species, such as [Me3Si(CF3)2]\u2212 or [Me3Si(F)(CF3)]\u2212.\nThe reactivity of fluoroform in combination with a strong base such as t-BuOK with carbonyl compounds in DMF is an example. Here CF3\u2212 and DMF form an hemiaminolate adduct ([Me2NCH(O)CF3]K).\n\n\n=== Electrophilic trifluoromethylation ===\nIn electrophilic trifluoromethylation the active trifluoromethyl donor group carries a positive charge. Production of an CF3+ cation has been described as \"

His father, Friedrich von Frankenberg, was a German baron of independent means, while his mother, Jessie Elliot, was the daughter of a wealthy Australian industrialist family. Her family owned property in Algeria, where her father resided there for lengthy periods, and the young family spent some time in North Africa. This may be where Von Frankenberg first encountered Islam. He later became an Officer for the German Crown Prince, and developed an interest in collecting rare works on Eastern and Islamic literature.In 1925 and 1926 he attended the Sufi Movement Summer School, led annually by Inayat Khan at Suresnes, in France. He was accepted by Khan as a student (mureed), and given the Sufi name of Momin (meaning faithful), as well as instruction in spiritual practices.In 1927, Von Frankenberg immigrated to Australia. His mother had inherited a substantial estate from her father, but it had been frozen during World War I because Elliot and her son were German nationals.

"Lithuanian_Heavy_Draught| Horse breeds| Horse breeds originating in Lithuania| ","The Lithuanian Heavy Draught is a draught horse breed created in Lithuania during the 19th and 20th centuries. They are used mainly for heavy draught and farm work, as well as meat production and the improvement of other breeds.  The breed is currently near extinction..\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Lithuanian Heavy Draught was created during the late 19th century by crossing local Zhmud mares with Ardennes, Percheron, Brabant, and other heavy breeds.  The breeding was overseen by the Lithuanian Society for Breeding Work and Driving Horses beginning in 1894.  In 1923 additional heavy horses were imported from the Netherlands to re-establish the breed following World War I, and in 1925, 2000, and 2001 additional Ardennes horses were imported from Sweden.Initially, Lithuanian Heavy Draughts were included into herd books as Ardennes crossbreds.  A breed-specific herd book was issued from 1951 to 1996. The herd books for Lithuanian Heavy Draughts are now issued by the Lithuanian Horse Breeders Association, with purebred Lithuanian Draughts identified by their colour, conformation, and markings. In 1964 there were 62,000 Lithuanian Heavy Draughts in Lithuania. Recently, there has been a dramatic decrease in the breed population, with stallion numbers declining and breeding and working conditions deteriorating.  Currently, the breed is close to extinction, with less than 1000 horses thought to exist as of 2003.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe Lithuanian Heavy Draught generally stands 15 to 16 hands high, and may be bay, chestnut, black, grey or roan. Overall the breed is large and solid.  The head is well-proportioned with a straight profile and heavy jaw.  The neck is short, muscular, and arched, the withers broad and moderately pronounced and the chest wide, deep and muscular.  The back is long, and generally straight, although it can be slightly dipped, and the croup rounded, long and muscled.  The legs are short, solid, and muscular with broad, strong joints and well-formed hooves.  Defects occasionally shown include a coarse head and an excessively dipped back.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nThe Lithuanian Heavy Draught is used mainly for heavy draught and farm work. In Lithuania draught capacity testing began in 1857, and since 2002 the Lithuanian Horse Breeders Association has taken over the responsibility of heavy horse testing.  Recently, more have begun to be exported for meat. They are also used to improve other breeds.  When crossed with native Altai horses, they improved the meat and milk yield and also increased the weight, growth rate, and ability to withstand year-round grazing conditions.\n\n\n== References =="
"Global_game| Game theory game classes| ","In economics and game theory, global games are games of incomplete information where players receive possibly-correlated signals of the underlying state of the world. Global games were originally defined by Carlsson and van Damme (1993).The most important practical application of global games has been the study of crises in financial markets such as bank runs, currency crises, and bubbles. However, they have other relevant applications such as investments with payoff complementarities, beauty contests, political riots and revolutions, and any other economic situation which displays strategic complementarity.\n\n\n== Global games in models of currency crises ==\nStephen Morris and Hyun Song Shin (1998) considered a stylized currency crises model, in which traders observe the relevant fundamentals with small noise, and show that this leads to the selection of a unique equilibrium. This result overturns the result in models of complete information, which feature multiple equilibria.\nOne concern with the robustness of this result is that the introduction of a theory of prices in global coordination games may reintroduce multiplicity of equilibria. This concern was addressed in Angeletos and Werning (2006) as well as Hellwig and coauthors (2006). They show that equilibrium multiplicity may be restored by the existence of prices acting as an endogenous public signal, provided that private information is sufficiently precise.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJorge, Jos\u00e9; Rocha, Joana (2015). \"
"99p_Stores| British companies established in 2001| British companies disestablished in 2016| Arts and crafts retailers| Defunct retail companies of the United Kingdom| Variety stores| Retail companies established in 2001| Retail companies disestablished in 2016| Discount shops of the United Kingdom| ","99p Stores Ltd. was a family-run business founded in January 2001 by entrepreneur Nadir Lalani, who opened the first store in the chain in Holloway, London, with a further three stores opening later that year. In 2002, Lalani decided to expand the business throughout the UK and had rapidly developed 99p Stores, operating a total of 129 stores as of March 2010 and serving around 1.5 million customers each week, undercutting their main rival Poundland by a penny. As of mid-2009 the company offered more than 3,500 different product lines throughout its stores.Most of their stores were based in the south of the UK, although there were stores as far north as Liverpool and Hartlepool. The chain saw accelerated store expansion upon the collapse of Woolworths Group, where they took the opportunity to acquire 15 of these former stores, increasing their estate to 79 at that time. Landlords were regarding 99p Stores as an anchor tenant due to the significant number of customers one of their stores could bring to a location.Although the retailer made a pre-tax loss of \u00a31.14 million in the year to 31 January 2007, they claimed that, since then, consumers had become more cautious with their money and where they spend it, in response to the economic conditions. The retailer had noticed an increase of customers from the wealthier AB social grade (a system of demographic classification used in the United Kingdom) during the recession. Customers had tended to speak positively about 99p Stores, with most reviewers noting customer and product overcrowding as their biggest criticisms, yet still rated the chain 4.5/5 on average.In February 2015, Poundland agreed to buy 99p Stores for \u00a355 million, with regulatory approval received in September 2015. The 99p Stores fascia began being phased out in favour of Poundland branding from late 2015.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\n\nNadir Lalani came to the UK in 1973 from Tanzania, having owned a cash and carry store in Mwanza. Since moving to the UK he built up and sold two convenience store chains (including buying Whistlestop Discount Stores, a 27-strong chain which he sold in 2005) before moving into discount retailing, with intentions of handing the business over to his two sons, who also work for the company, in due course. Lalani was inspired to start 99p Stores after stumbling upon a bustling Poundland shop whilst wandering around a shopping centre. His first store opened on 18 January 2001, with over 3,500 customers visiting the store in the first day of trading. As of mid-2009, the company offered more than 3,500 different product lines throughout its stores.\n\n\n=== Growth ===\nThe company relocated their headquarters to a new, 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2) base in Daventry in 2007, giving them capacity to go to 120 stores with existing infrastructure. Discount shops, including 99p Stores, had seen store numbers increase by 60% during the economic downturn, with two discount stores opening for every one store that has closed. The retailer took advantage of the tough economic climate of the late 2000s, having doubled the number of their stores during the period August 2008 - August 2009, and had further plans to double existing store numbers and current market share within the 18 months following October 2009.In August 2009, Retail Week reported that the retailer was to review its ownership structure, potentially resulting in a sale as early as summer 2010 or a flotation within the next three years. The retailer had said they would want 150 shops before considering any offers to buy a stake in the business, mentioning the advantages of a flotation to include further investment, as well as the Lalani family being able to retain a stake and an element of control in the business.\n\n\n=== Management ===\nIn October 2009, the retailer appointed Gordon Brown as their new chairman, who took up the position on 1 October 2009, taking over from Peter Gent. Brown, having previously served as managing director at Wilkinson between 1991 and 2007, joined the company at a time when it was embarking on aggressive expansion and assessing its long-term options.\n\n\n== Business practice ==\n\n\n=== Sales strategy ===\nWhen inflation pushes up prices beyond what the company is able to pay, this is often easily worked around by reducing the quantity supplied in each item, for example by reducing the amount of tape on reels of selotape, or selling eggs by the dozen instead of 18s. Nadir's son and buying director, Faisal, who took care of the day-to-day running, noted that the lowest margin he will work with is 20 percent. In response to the planned VAT rise to 20% in January 2011, the budget chain said it would not change its prices but would stop selling goods that did not make a profit.Towards the end of 2009, 99p Stores replaced their Torex electronic point of sale system with one provided by Futura to operate their touchscreen Intelligent Registers (IRs). As well as allowing the retailer to understand which products customers are buying, through up-to-date tracking of the most popular products, it allowed stock to be moved around the business quickly. Other functionality included its allocation and replenishment capabilities, helping to ensure constant stock via automated ordering. Following a successful pilot (in which the company tested the new system in a select number of stores before committing to it), Futura scheduled an ambitious roll-out programme at the end of 2009 to change both software and platform, reducing the normal roll-out period from six months to two months. The Futura team installed the system with Digipos touch-screen tills each evening after trading, enabling the store to start trading the very next day. Simultaneously, new chip-and-pin capability was being introduced, to ensure the company is PCI compliant, with contactless payments to follow.\n\n\n=== Products offered ===\n\nThe retailer offered a large range of products in its 3,500 lines, from \"

"Vermilacinia_johncassadyi| Lichens described in 1996| Fungi of Mexico| Lichens| Ramalinaceae| ","Vermilacinia johncasadyi is a rare fruticose lichen, found on rocks along the Pacific Coast of Baja California peninsula on Punta Cono, and directly westward across the ocean on Cedros Island.\n\n\n== Distinguishing features ==\nVermilacinia johncassadyi is classified in the subgenus Vermilacinia, distinguished from related species by its thallus divided into strap-like branches arising from a blackened base to about \u00bc the way up the branches, and by producing lichen substances of triterpenes referred to as T1 and T2 in reference to their Rf class on thin-layer chromatography plates.  Apothecia, which develop in some thalli, occur in terminal clusters, sometimes extending down along the branch margins. The strap-like branches are recurved in forms that produce apothecia, and erect in forms lacking apothecia.\nVermilacinia laevigata is morphologically similar to V. johncassadyi in its strap-like branches.  It differs in its lichen substances (contains T3, not T1 and T2), and development of its apothecia elevated from the branch by a short narrower stalk-like lobe, in contrast to apothecia in V.  johncassadyi that appear to pinch off from the branch margins, occurring in aggregate and often not fully developed, the margins notably wavy as a result.\nThe species was named after a chemist, John Cassady, who was Chairman of the Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy at Purdue University, and later Dean of the School of Pharmacy at Ohio State University while the species was under investigation.  He, and his graduate student, Thomas McCloud, had accompanied Richard Spjut on an expedition to Baja California during May 1986 for the collection of plant and lichen samples in search of new chemical compounds for treating cancer.\n\n\n== Lichen substances ==\nVermilacinia johncasadyi contains predominantly terpenes but lacks the T3 compound as noted above, and also lacks accessory depsidones such as salazinic acid. It is one of a small number of species in the genus with a distinctive chemistry of secondary triterpenes referred to as T1 and T2. These triterpenes are found only in subgenus Vermilacinia, and only in species that occur in the central region of Baja California.

"Information_technology_generalist| Computer occupations| ","An information technology generalist is a technology professional proficient in many facets of information technology without any specific specialty. Furthermore, an IT generalist is generally considered to possess general business knowledge and soft skills allowing them to be adaptable in a wide array of work environments. The IT Generalist is often able to fulfill many different roles within a company depending on specific technology needs. In a small business environment, budgets often delegate many different facets of technology to a single individual, especially considering a small business will often require an individual proficient in desktop support, web page design, databases, phone systems, and even server administration. The role of the IT Generalist within a larger company, however, often becomes more of a project leader or integrations specialist due to a project team consisting of a varying degree of IT specialists and interfacing with end-users requiring soft-skills.\n\n\n== Industry role ==\nThe information technology industry consists of many disparate technologies that each serve a critical piece of the total technology puzzle. As technology practices change new methods, techniques, and tools become available that often require human expertise in order to implement and maintain technology systems. The human expertise required in order to manage these new systems has given rise to what is defined as an IT specialist\u2014someone with an expert level of competency and knowledge on a particular piece of technology. In comparison, the IT Generalist does not possess the expert knowledge to implement an advanced system but instead possesses the knowledge and experience to ensure all of the disparate technologies can function properly together.The generalist has become an increasingly valuable asset to a company, especially when it comes to the rapidly changing field of technology. In many cases, companies are more apt to demand hiring and retaining employees that are multi-functional, especially those that have analytical abilities such as critical reasoning and statistical analysis.\n\n\n== Market trends ==\nMarket trends tend to be moving away from the hiring of IT specialists and instead individuals who possess a more broad technical base with additional soft-skills such as enthusiasm, passion, and energy. In even some cases, IT specialists with years of experience may be passed over for more malleable hires because as technology changes innovation may be stifled by specialists not being able to adjust to new procedures and processes in the market. The attributes associated with an IT generalist have been defined in other occupational series as well. In a study conducted over five years with over 250 political science specialists their political predictions were recorded along with a large sample of generalist's political predictions to determine if specialists with their expert knowledge were more effective in their forecasts. The study discovered that those with limited political science exposure were more accurate in their predictions\u2014most likely as a result of their more varied and un-focused exposure to political science as compared to those of the specialists.\n\n\n== Arguments for and against ==\nThe debate between the IT generalist and specialist has been going on for years as companies are trying to determine how to best utilize their IT department skills and assets. Up until recently the general consensus of the market has been the hiring of IT specialists due to the implementation of advanced technologies such as cloud computing, next-generation mobile application development, and the virtualization of technology infrastructure. It has been found, however, that the hiring of specialists has led to the rise of silos of talent within a company leading to difficulty implementing new business processes and taking advantage of inter-departmental collaboration. This compartmentalization of knowledge and skills has led to companies shifting focus to the hiring and implementing of IT Generalists for the purposes of implementing a more mobile, adaptable, and diverse technology department.\nAccording to multiple studies in 2010 companies who were surveyed noted their goal was to reduce the amount of specialists they hire and instead hiring \u201cversatilists.\u201d These versatilists are synonymous with IT Generalists because they have an overall general sense of technology as well as business knowledge while also possessing \u201csoft skills\u201d that are considered lacking in technology-minded individuals focused on specific technology skill-sets.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nTetlock, Philip (2005).

During a 14-year baseball career, he played in the Negro leagues and Major League Baseball from 1948 through 1968, primarily for the New York Yankees. A 12-time All-Star, he also played for the Kansas City Monarchs and the Boston Red Sox. Howard served on the Yankees' coaching staff from 1969 to 1979.\nIn 1955, he was the first African American player on the Yankees roster; this was eight years after Jackie Robinson had broken  the MLB color barrier in 1947. Howard was named the American League's Most Valuable Player for the 1963 pennant winners after finishing third in the league in slugging average and fifth in home runs, becoming the first black player in AL history to win the honor. He won Gold Glove Awards in 1963 and 1964, in the latter season setting AL records for putouts and total chances in a season. His lifetime fielding percentage of .993 as a catcher was a major league record from 1967 to 1973, and he retired among the AL career leaders in putouts (7th, 6,447) and total chances (9th, 6,977).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHoward was born in St. Louis, Missouri to Travis Howard and Emaline Hill, a nurse at a local hospital.

He was an outfielder for three seasons and in 1950 roomed with Ernie Banks.The Yankees signed Howard on July 19, 1950, after he was purchased along with Frank Barnes. They  were assigned to the Muskegon Clippers, the Yankees' farm team in the Central League.Howard missed the 1951 and 1952 seasons due to his military service in the U.S. Army.\nIn 1953, Howard played for the Kansas City Blues of the Class AAA American Association. The next year, the Yankees invited Howard to spring training and converted him into a catcher, despite the presence of Yogi Berra as the Yankees' starting catcher.He played with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Class AAA International League in 1954, where he led the league in triples, with 16, to go along with 22 home runs, 109 runs batted in and a .330 average, winning the league's MVP award.\nThe Yankees assigned Bill Dickey to work with Howard in order to develop his catching skills.\n\n\n== Major league career ==\n\n\n=== 1950s ===\nHoward made the Yankees' major league roster at the start of the 1955 season.

"Hagoth| Book of Mormon people| Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact| Mormonism and Pacific Islanders| Mormon folklore| ","According to the Book of Mormon, Hagoth () was a Nephite ship builder who lived in or around 55 BCE. At least two of the ships he built were lost. The occupants of one ship were presumed drowned. Hagoth and his shipbuilding accomplishments are briefly described in the book of Alma in the Book of Mormon:\n\n 5  And it came to pass that Hagoth, he being an exceedingly curious man, therefore he went forth and built him an exceedingly large ship, on the borders of the land Bountiful, by the land Desolation, and launched it forth into the west sea, by the narrow neck which led into the land northward.   6  And behold, there were many of the Nephites who did enter therein and did sail forth with much provisions, and also many women and children; and they took their course northward. And thus ended the thirty and seventh year.\n   7  And in the thirty and eighth year, this man built other ships. And the first ship did also return, and many more people did enter into it; and they also took much provisions, and set out again to the land northward.\n   8  And it came to pass that they were never heard of more. And we suppose that they were drowned in the depths of the sea. And it came to pass that one other ship also did sail forth; and whither she did go we know not. (Alma 63:5-8)\n\n\n== Polynesian theory ==\nNon-scriptural sources suggest that Hagoth led an expedition, sailing into the Pacific Ocean from the Americas. Some leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and scholars have stated that the peoples of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Polynesia, and New Zealand, are descendants of the Nephite Hagoth and his followers. According to the Book of Mormon, the Nephites were descendants of Israel. Many members of the LDS Church in Polynesia have come to believe that Hagoth is their ancestor. Non-Mormon scholars largely dismiss this hypothesis, citing genetic, archaeological, and anthropological evidence which indicates that Polynesian peoples come from Maritime Southeast Asia.Despite general agreement among scholars that the principal ancestors of Polynesian peoples migrated from Southeast Asia, there are a few evidences of the possibility of contact with peoples in the Western Hemisphere. Sweet potatoes, which are native to South America, are a common traditional staple throughout Polynesia. The Quechua word for sweet potato is kumar, very similar to the Polynesian word kumara for the same plant. There is also DNA evidence of contact between Polynesian and South American peoples prior to European contact.Differentiating between scriptural and apocryphal accounts of Hagoth and his ships, one LDS writer makes the following observations:\n\n The Book of Mormon does not equate the \"

"Political_unitarism| Political terminology| ","Political unitarism designates various theories, concepts or policies that advocate or enforce a fully unified and centralized system of government, with ultimate goal in creating a unitary state. In practice, unitarism is often manifested as a political doctrine or movement within complex political entities (confederations, federations, and other political unions), advocating for the highest degree of political integration and unification, beyond mere administrative centralization.One of the main goals of political unitarists (proponents of unitarism) is to abolish or substantially suppress all forms of regional self-government and autonomy, by transferring powers of confederated states, federal units, autonomous regions or cantons directly to the central government. Unitarization and regionalization are often confused with centralization and decentralization, respectively.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHistorically, complex processes of political unitarization were often accompanied by political struggle between proponents of unitarism and radical centralization, and their opponents, advocating decentralization and regionalism. In political history, that kind of political struggle was very frequent, even from ancient times. One of the most famous examples of local resistance to political unitarism in classical times was the internal conflict between ancient Athens and other federated city-states within the Delian League.\nIn modern history, one of the most notable examples of political unitarization was the creation of Kingdom of Great Britain by the Acts of Union in 1701, and subsequently the creation of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland by the Acts of Union in 1800.\nOne of practical goals of political unitarism is to create a singular legislature, with exclusive legislative powers over the entire territory of a state. Through the process of political unitarization, local regions within an emerging unitary state are deprived of any form of contract with the centralized government. Thus, the remaining regional powers, if any have been left at all, are not protected by being entrenched in the constitution of the unitary state; they can be reduced even more, or completely abolished, by the acts of the central government.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUnitary state\nCentralization\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhilip Camara (2016): Federalism's advantages over unitarism"

These Orders in Council had been the chosen method of implementation of Resolution 1373 and the directives of the 1267 Committee. The legislation was introduced in the House of Commons on 5 February 2010 and received royal assent on 10 February.\n\n\n== Judgment ==\nThe Act was passed following the HM Treasury v Ahmed ruling by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom on 27 January 2010 that asset-freezing orders made under the United Nations Act 1946 \u2013 specifically the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2009, the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006, the Al-Qa\u2019ida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2002, the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2001 and the Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 \u2013 were unlawful, because the 1946 Act was not intended to authorise coercive measures which interfere with fundamental rights without parliamentary scrutiny:\nThere was no indication during the [February 1946] debates at Second Reading in either House that it was envisaged that the Security Council would find it necessary under article 41 to require states to impose restraints or take coercive measures against their own citizens. The question whether it would be appropriate, if it were to do so, for the Government to be given power to introduce such measures by Orders in Council in the manner envisaged by the Bill was not discussed.\nMultiple persons, multiple orders and a forest of laws, Statutory Orders and UNSC resolutions were considered in the judgment. The applicants pleaded variously that the Treasury Orders were ultra vires for various reasons:\n\nillegality because it was passed without Parliamentary approval,\nlack of legal certainty and proportionality,\nthe absence of procedures that enabled designated persons to challenge their designation,\nby virtue of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 because they were incompatible with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and with article 1 of Protocol 1 of the ECHR,\nviolated client's right of access to a court for an effective remedy.Lord Phillips concluded that\n\nNobody should conclude that the result of these appeals constitutes judicial interference with the will of Parliament. On the contrary it upholds the supremacy of Parliament in deciding whether or not measures should be imposed that affect the fundamental rights of those in this country.\n\n\n== Legislation ==\nWhen the court refused to stay its judgement on 4 February, the 2010 Act was passed to retrospectively validate the orders until Parliament could pass new asset-freezing legislation which complied with the court's judgement.Speaking in the House of Commons on 8 February, Liberal Democrat MP David Heath said of the bill:\n\n[T]he legislation is before us because the Government have been found to be acting ultra vires and failing to secure proper parliamentary approval ... However, the arrogance of this Government and, in particular, the Treasury means that they do not understand what Parliament is for, and they do not understand the proper scrutiny of Bills.\n\n\n== Repeal ==\nThe Act was repealed by the Terrorist Asset-Freezing etc. Act 2010, a full legislative text with which to implement Resolution 1373.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTerrorism Acts\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 881/2002\nInterpol notice\nRules Publication Act 1893\nHani al-Sibai\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nExplanatory notes from the Office of Public Sector Information website\nBBC Democracy Live discussion on the Terrorist Asset-Freezing (Temporary Provisions) Act 2010"

"Punalur_Suspension_Bridge| Bridges in Kerala| Buildings and structures in Kollam district| 1877 establishments in India| Bridges completed in 1877| Suspension bridges in India| Transport in Kollam district| ","The Punalur Suspension Bridge, located in Punalur is the oldest motorable Bridge in Kerala, which was built by Travancore Government and is now a historical attraction. The bridge has a length of 400 feet (120 m). The suspension bridge was built to prevent wild animals from crossing into the town from the forest area of old Kattupathanapuram.\n\n\n== History and Construction ==\n \n\nThe Punalur Suspension Bridge is the first motorable bridge in South India. The suspension bridge crossing the river is the only suspended-deck type in south India. Built in 1877 by Albert Henry across the Kallada River, this huge bridge was suspended by two spans and was used for vehicular movement. Construction took more than six years. It is said that after completion of the bridge people hesitated to walk over the bridge. In order to prove the strength of the bridge the engineer and his family passed under the bridge in a country boat while six elephants were walking over it. Now the bridge is of historical interest and is a major tourist attraction.\n\n\n=== Reason for the construction ===\n\nThe main concept behind the construction of this bridge was that areas on the other side of the river Kallada was dense forests. A bridge was necessary. It was also built to prevent wild animals from getting to the populated side, a bridge which shakes when some one gets on it was built, this shaking scared off the animals and they wouldn't cross the bridge.\n\n\n=== Method of Construction ===\nThe bridge is connected to four wells. The iron rods of the bridge is connected to the clips, situated in the wells. Each well is about 100 feet deep and no one since knows the engineering behind the construction of this bridge. It still remains a mystery.\n\n\n== Replacement for the suspension bridge ==\nA new concrete bridge was built near to the Punalur Suspension Bridge in 1972 due to heavy traffic on the National Highway 208, a new strong bridge was built.\n\n\n== Renovation ==\n\nThe bridge was recently repaired and renovated by the government of Kerala. The structure was strengthened, new wood panels of the same tree (Kambakom) which was first used in the construction were fit, the steel armrests and the stone columns were painted, night lamps were installed and a new park and resting place were made near the bridge.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Punalur suspension bridge at Wikimedia Commons\n\nSketchUp Model of the Bridge"

Members of the family have included:\n\nJean-Baptiste van Rysselberghe (1820\u20131892) carpenter and entrepreneur.\nFran\u00e7ois van Rysselberghe (1846\u20131893), scientist and inventor, son of Jean-Baptiste.\nMax van Rysselberghe (1878\u20131952), engineer, son of Fran\u00e7ois.\nEnrique van Rysselberghe Mart\u00ednez (1911\u20131984), politician, mayor of Concepci\u00f3n, son of Max.\nEnrique van Rysselberghe Varela (1937\u20132013), architect, businessman and politician, son of Enrique.\nJacqueline van Rysselberghe (born 1965), surgeon and Chilean senator, daughter of Enrique Jr.\nEnrique van Rysselberghe Herrera (born 1976), engineer and Chilean senator, son of Enrique Jr.\nCharles van Rysselberghe (1850\u20131920), architect, son of Jean-Baptiste.\nJulien Marie van Rysselberghe (1852\u20131931), engineer and professor, son of Jean-Baptiste.\nOctave van Rysselberghe (1855\u20131929), architect, son of Jean-Baptiste.\nTh\u00e9o van Rysselberghe (1862\u20131926), painter, son of Jean-Baptiste.\n\u00c9lisabeth van Rysselberghe (1890\u20131980), translator, daughter of Th\u00e9o.\nCatherine Gide (1923\u20132013), daughter of \u00c9lisabeth.\n\n\n== The family ==\nThe Van Rysselberghe family is recorded as early as in the 17th century in Laarne, Flanders, where on 14 May 1695 Jacques van Rysselberghe married Andr\u00e9e Crabeels.Jean-Baptist van Rysselebrghe, a carpenter and wheelwright by trade, established himself in Ghent as an entrepreneur. He married M\u00e9lanie Rommens, with whom he had six children, including five sons, who would rise to fame as prominent artists and intellectuals. They were Fran\u00e7ois van Rysselberghe (1846 \u2013 1893), Charles van Rysselberghe (1850 \u2013 1920), Julien Marie van Rysselberghe (1852 \u2013 1931), Octave van Rysselberghe (1855 \u2013 1929), and Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe (1862 \u2013 1926).Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe was a prominent painter, who played a pivotal role in the European art scene at the turn of the twentieth century. After him, the most prominent member of the family is perhaps Fran\u00e7ois. He was a scientist and inventor, a forerunner and inventor of numerous devices in the fields of meteorology and telephony. Octave and Charles were both architects, whereas Julien Marie was an engineer of bridges and roads, as well as a professor of engineering at Ghent University. Jean-Baptist and M\u00e9lanie had also a daughter, Sylvia-Maria, who married a Chilean engineer.Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe married Maria Monnom from Brussels in 1889. Their daughter, \u00c9lisabeth van Rysselberghe, had a daughter, Catherine, with writer Andr\u00e9 Gide.Max van Rysselberghe, a son of Fran\u00e7ois, became engineer and embarked on a scientific expedition to Antarctica (the Belgian Antarctic Expedition) at the end of the 19th century, when he wasn't yet 20 years old. The expedition was supposed to last six months, but the ship became trapped in the ice and they were forced to winter in the Antarctic region, the first expedition to do so. The ice that blocked the ship didn't melt in the summer, so they decided to cut a channel to reach the open sea. Max van Rysselberghe used explosive to break the ice. Thus the presumed dead crew was able to return to Belgium after setting foot on Chile in Punta Arenas. Back in Belgium, Max van Rysselberghe met Isabel Mart\u00ednez, daughter of Chilean engineer Valent\u00edn Mart\u00ednez. In 1905, Van Rysselberghe went again to Chile. He took charge of several regulatory plans for towns near Santiago and Valpara\u00edso before settling in Concepci\u00f3n. He and Isabel had four children: Lidia, Ivonne, Enrique and Daniel. Enrique became director de obra in Concepci\u00f3n and later in life was elected regidor and then mayor of the city. He married Julieta Varela, by whom he had four children: Javier, Enrique, Ivonne and Astrid. Enrique Jr. became a deputy and married Mar\u00eda Norma Herrera. They had five children, the eldest of whom is Chilean surgeon and senator Jacqueline van Rysselberghe, while the penultimate is Chilean engineer and senator Enrique van Rysselberghe Herrera.The Chilean Van Rysselberghe live chiefly in Concepci\u00f3n, with some branches in Santiago and Linares.\n\n\n== References =="

"Mervyn_Williams_(artist)| Living people| 1940 births| New Zealand artists| People from Whakatāne| Elam Art School alumni| ","Mervyn John Williams  (born 22 April 1940) is a New Zealand artist. He was an early exponent of Op art in New Zealand in the 1960s\u201370s. In 1990 he originated a style of illusionary abstract painting based on chiaroscuro, creating the impression of three-dimensional forms and textures on a flat canvas. Since 2009 he has used digital techniques in returning to an Op art style. Williams is almost unique amongst his contemporaries in New Zealand art for having embraced abstraction at the start of his career and exclusively throughout. His work is held in all major New Zealand public collections. A monograph by Edward Hanfling was published by Ron Sang in 2014 coinciding with a survey exhibition.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWilliams was born in Whakat\u0101ne on 22 April 1940. He moved between the Bay of Plenty Region and Auckland between 1940 and 1951 when he settled permanently in Auckland. He began secondary school at Avondale College in 1954, where his art teacher was Robert Nettleton Field. In 1956, Williams was obliged to leave school prematurely to help support his family following the death of his father, though Field continued to mentor his former student.In 1955, Williams began work at ceramics firm Crown Lynn, where he received guidance and encouragement from Frank Carpay. He subsequently pursued a more intensive design opportunity at Ted Dutch's art and design studio, receiving training in painting, design and graphic techniques until 1961 when he established his own studio. In 1957 and 1958, Williams attended Elam School of Fine Arts part-time, where he met Don Binney and Graham Percy.Williams married Helen Jermyn in 1962. They had three sons, and from 1965 to 1972 lived near Te Henga (Bethells Beach), in West Auckland. The couple divorced in 1985. In the mid-1960s, photographer Marti Friedlander made a series of portraits of Williams.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early work ===\nWilliams made oil paintings as well as works in gouache on paper during the years 1956 to 1961. They feature adjacent and layered patches of mainly muted colour along with linear elements. There are similarities to the paintings of Ted Dutch and to mid-twentieth-century School of Paris abstract painters, such as Vieira da Silva and Georges Mathieu. Beginning in the early 1960s, Williams began to make work with strong geometric shapes influenced by Josef Albers and Mark Rothko.\n\n\n=== Op art ===\n\nIn the early to mid 1960s, Williams began working in the Op art style that developed over the same period in Europe and the United States. His compositions of closely spaced lines, geometric shapes and high-keyed, contrasting colours were carefully rendered to create optical illusions and vibrations. He aimed to create the impression of movement and three-dimensionality on a static, two-dimensional painted surface, and to bring the experience of visual art closer to that of music, unfolding over time. The Chromatic Invention series (1969\u201370) reflects the artist's admiration of Johann Sebastian Bach, and his belief that invention is the most important quality in art.Williams' work of the 1960s and 1970s relates to that of European artists such as Bridget Riley and Victor Vasarely. Op art came to prominence in the United States with the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s exhibition The Responsive Eye in 1965, and had a large public following. In New Zealand, a small number of artists worked in an Op style, notably Gordon Walters and Ray Thorburn. Williams and Walters travelled to Melbourne, Australia, together in 1975, breaking their return journey to visit Sydney to see an exhibition of recent paintings by Bridget Riley at the Coventry Gallery.Williams\u2019 Op art was partly a reaction against the emphasis on expressive mark-making and individual style in 1950s Abstract Expressionism. He believed in the universal appeal of optical illusion, declaring that it \u201cappeals to a more innocent side of ourselves\u201d. He experimented with photo-mechanical techniques to produce optical patterns as efficiently as possible and in multiples, thereby making it available to more people. The exactitude and impersonal finish of Williams\u2019 paintings directs the viewer\u2019s attention to the images themselves and their own perception, rather than the artist\u2019s touch or sensibility.Important series from Williams\u2019 Op art phase of the 1970s include the Daedal series, the Quotient (1973) and Delta (1978\u201380) series. These series were shown during the 1970s at Barry Lett Galleries in Auckland and the Elva Bett Gallery in Wellington. A selection from all three series was shown in a two-person exhibition with Gordon Walters at the Canterbury Society of Arts Gallery in 1984.\n\n\n=== Crusties ===\nIn 1980 Williams visited New York and London, and saw the exhibition A New Spirit in Painting at the Royal Academy, London, and other important exhibitions in New York, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. Upon his return he began to make paintings with thickly encrusted paint and simpler compositions. However, the interest in perception continued, as the raised paint surfaces and layering of colours generated a play of light and shadow.Williams was part of the Seven Painters/The Eighties exhibition that toured New Zealand during 1982\u201383, starting at the Sarjeant Gallery in Whanganui. The exhibition also featured Gretchen Albrecht, Stephen Bambury, Max Gimblett, Richard Killeen, James Ross, and Ian Scott. In 1983, Williams was included in the exhibition The Grid: Lattice and Network at the Auckland City Art Gallery.In the second half of the 1980s, Williams continued his quest to \u201carticulate light\u201d, using gels and pastes to produce a concrete or tactile support that he then sprayed with thin films of paint. Paintings such as Chart (1989) and Desert Sand (1986) generate changing effects of light and colour that depend on the conditions under which they are seen and the position of the viewer.Williams\u2019 paintings of this period have similarities with the 1970s \u201cthick field\u201d abstract paintings of American artists Jules Olitski and Larry Poons. However, art historian Michael Dunn contrasts Williams\u2019 interest in light and illusion with the emphasis on flatness and objecthood in American abstraction.\n\n\n=== Wooden constructions ===\n\nIn 1989, Williams was awarded the Tylee Cottage Residency in Whanganui, a position administered by the Sarjeant Gallery Te Whare o Rehua, and he continued to live in Whanganui until 1991. He collected wooden detritus washed down the Whanganui River from beaches around the river mouth, and with the aid of a local joiner created subtle geometric compositions. Williams was attracted to the natural textures, tones and patterns of the weathered wood, and he has said that their \u201csurfaces had an eloquence about them that had evolved spontaneously, rather than been laboured over with modelling paste.\u201d Notable examples are Odyssey (1989, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o T\u0101maki) and Organon 1 (1989, Sarjeant Gallery Te Whare o Rehua).\nThe wooden constructions were exhibited at Gow Langsford Gallery, Auckland, in July\u2013August 1989, and later that year under the title Points of Departure at the Sarjeant Gallery, where Williams also made a large sculptural installation in the central domed space.\n\n\n=== Illusionary paintings ===\n\nDuring 1990\u201391, while living in Whanganui, Williams worked on techniques for creating the illusion of physical texture on a flat, painted surface. Eventually, using a thin film of paint and creating fine shifts in tone and colour, he achieved an almost photographic rendering of effects of light and shadow. The series evolved as a number of distinct formats or groups, each based on a simple, geometric structure. The paintings are primarily studies in perception and light. Williams has been likened to a \u201cmagician\u201d because his paintings generate responses of surprise and wonder, and a degree of mystery surrounds his technique. The illusionary paintings are considered an original achievement, without obvious precedent in the history of art internationally. They were first exhibited at Gow Langsford Gallery in March 1992, following Williams\u2019 return to Auckland the previous year.\nThe illusionary paintings are representational in the manner of the Old Masters, and can thus be described accurately as trompe-l'\u0153il works, but they represent abstract forms and ambiguous phenomena. Williams has described them as \u201cat once both totally abstract and as representational as you can get.\u201d According to curator Anna-Marie White, Williams is significant because \u201che created a new direction within abstract painting while simultaneously challenging the very nature of abstraction as a non-representational art form.\u201d Important examples of the illusionary paintings are Where Corals Lie (1994, Rutherford Collection) and Precept (Gold) (2005, private collection).\nThe illusionary paintings draw attention to perception itself, and encourage critical reflection on the relationship between what we see and what we believe we see.\n\n\n=== Digital mixed media paintings ===\n\nWilliams began to experiment with digital techniques in 2009, leading him to revisit his Op style of the 1960s and 1970s. He developed a new body of work combining digital processes with traditional painting techniques. Works such as Solar Flare (2011), Centrifuge (2013) and Paragon (2013) create optical vibrations that would have been difficult to achieve before the advent of digital technology. Parallels have been drawn between Williams' attitude to digital technology and the spirit of excitement, hope and innovation that informed his original Op works in the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Sculpture ===\nWilliams has produced sculpture throughout his career, though it was only during his time in Whanganui that it came to the fore. In 2007 he began to devote more time to sculpture, and produced a series of works using tubular modules in bronze, stainless steel, aluminium and concrete, realising them on an increasingly large scale.\n\n\n== Major exhibitions ==\n2015 Fa\u00e7ade, ARTIS Gallery, Auckland\n2014 Lost for Words: Mervyn Williams: From Modernism to the Digital Age, Gus Fisher Gallery, Auckland\n2008 Sleight of Hand, Suter Art Gallery, Nelson\n2000 Opposites Attract, with Paul Dibble, Michael Carr Art Dealer, Sydney\n1997 Ross Bleckner, Mark Francis, Mervyn Williams, Gow Langsford Gallery, Auckland\n1996 Visa Gold Award, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o T\u0101maki\n1994 Parallel Lines: Gordon Walters in Context, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o T\u0101maki\n1992 Surface Tension, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o T\u0101maki\n1990 Out of the Woods, Sarjeant Gallery Te Whare o Rehua Whanganui\n1989 Points of Departure, Sarjeant Gallery Te Whare o Rehua Whanganui\n1984 Gordon Walters and Mervyn Williams, Canterbury Society of Arts Gallery, Christchurch\n1983 Aspects of Recent New Zealand Art: The Grid: Lattice and Network, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o T\u0101maki\n1982 Seven Painters/The Eighties, Sarjeant Gallery Te Whare o Rehua Whanganui, touring exhibition\n1980 Benson and Hedges Art Award Exhibition\n1978 Auckland Painters Exhibition, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o T\u0101maki\n1972 Biennale of Graphic Art, Paris\n1970 NZ Pavilion, Expo 70, Japan\n1967 Two-person exhibition with Pat Hanly, Wellington\n1966 International Biennale of Graphic Art, Tokyo\n\n\n== Collections ==\nAuckland Art Gallery Toi o T\u0101maki\nChartwell Collection, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o T\u0101maki\nChristchurch Art Gallery Te Puna o Waiwhetu\nDunedin Public Art Gallery\nMuseum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa\nSarjeant Gallery Te Whare o Rehua, Whanganui\nSuter Art Gallery, Nelson\nTe Manawa Art Gallery, Palmerston North\nUniversity of Auckland\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="

"Alexander_of_Lincoln| 1148 deaths| 12th-century English people| 12th-century English Roman Catholic bishops| Bishops of Lincoln| History of Lincolnshire| People from Blois| ","Alexander of Lincoln (died February 1148) was a medieval English Bishop of Lincoln, a member of an important administrative and ecclesiastical family. He was the nephew of Roger of Salisbury, a Bishop of Salisbury and Chancellor of England under King Henry I, and he was also related to Nigel, Bishop of Ely. Educated at Laon, Alexander served in his uncle's diocese as an archdeacon in the early 1120s. Unlike his relatives, he held no office in the government before his appointment as Bishop of Lincoln in 1123. Alexander became a frequent visitor to King Henry's court after his appointment to the episcopate, often witnessing royal documents, and he served as a royal justice in Lincolnshire.\nAlthough Alexander was known for his ostentatious and luxurious lifestyle, he founded a number of religious houses in his diocese and was an active builder and literary patron. He also attended church councils and reorganised his diocese by increasing the number of archdeaconries and setting up prebends to support his cathedral clergy. Under Henry's successor, King Stephen, Alexander was caught up in the fall from favour of his family, and was imprisoned together with his uncle Roger in 1139. He subsequently briefly supported Stephen's rival, Matilda, but by the late 1140s Alexander was once again working with Stephen. He spent much of the late 1140s at the papal court in Rome, but died in England in early 1148. During his episcopate he began the rebuilding of his cathedral, which had been destroyed by fire. Alexander was the patron of medieval chroniclers Henry of Huntingdon and Geoffrey of Monmouth, and also served as an ecclesiastical patron of the medieval hermit Christina of Markyate and Gilbert of Sempringham, founder of the Gilbertines.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nAlexander was a nephew of Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, probably the son of Roger's brother Humphrey. His mother's name, Ada, is known from the Lincoln Cathedral libri memoriales, or obituary books. Alexander's brother David was archdeacon of Buckingham in the diocese of Lincoln. Other relatives included Nigel, another nephew of Roger's; and Adelelm, later Treasurer of England, who was recorded as Roger's nephew but perhaps was his son. It is possible, although unproven, that Nigel was really Alexander's brother rather than his cousin. Roger's son Roger le Poer, who later became Chancellor of England, was also a cousin. Alexander's cousin Nigel had a son, Richard FitzNeal, who later became Treasurer of England and Bishop of London. Alexander also had a nephew William, who became an archdeacon, and a great-nephew named Robert de Alvers.Alexander's birthdate is unknown. Together with his cousin Nigel he was educated at Laon, under the schoolmaster Anselm of Laon, and returned to England at some unknown date. The historian Martin Brett feels that Alexander probably served as a royal chaplain early in his career, although no sources support this conjecture. Alexander was an archdeacon in the diocese of Salisbury by 1121, under his uncle. While occupying that office he was credited with writing a glossary of Old English legal terms in the Anglo Norman language, entitled the Expositiones Vocabulorum. Unlike his cousin Nigel, Alexander does not appear to have entered the king's household or administration before his appointment as a bishop, and only attested, or witnessed, one royal charter before his appointment to the episcopate in 1123.\n\n\n== Bishop ==\nAlexander was nominated to the see of Lincoln in April 1123 and was consecrated bishop on 22 July 1123, at a ceremony held in Canterbury. He owed his appointment to his uncle's influence with King Henry I; the Peterborough version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle noted that Alexander's appointment to the episcopate was done entirely for the love of Roger.During his time as bishop Alexander secured the submission of St Albans Abbey to his diocese and founded a number of monasteries, including Haverholme Priory (a Gilbertine house), Dorchester on Thames (an Arrouaisian Order house), Louth Park, and Thame; Louth was one of the first Cistercian houses founded in England, and Dorchester was the refoundation of a former collegiate church. During Alexander's episcopate 13 Cistercian abbeys and seven nunneries were founded in his diocese. Alexander himself consecrated the church at Markyate used by the medieval mystic Christina of Markyate and her nuns, and it was he who consecrated her as a hermit at St Albans Abbey. Alexander also founded a hospital for lepers at Newark-on-Trent.Although Alexander was a frequent witness to royal charters and documents, there is no evidence that he held an official government position after his appointment as bishop, unlike his relatives Roger and Nigel. Nevertheless, Alexander subsequently appears to have become a regular presence at the royal court. He frequently attested royal charters after 1123, and probably acted as a royal justice in Lincolnshire and the town of Lincoln. He also held the royal castles at Newark, Sleaford and Banbury, and gave confirmations of grants to the church at Godstow.Alexander was probably at the 1125 church council held at Westminster by the papal legate John of Crema, and shortly afterwards accompanied the legate on his journey back to Rome. He was still in Rome in 1126, and may have helped to obtain a papal confirmation of his uncle's possession of Malmesbury Abbey, Abbotsbury Abbey, and Horton. At some point during his episcopate, an eighth archdeaconry was established in his diocese, for the West Riding area of Lindsey. Besides these reorganisations, Alexander had a number of clerics in his personal household, including Gilbert of Sempringham, who later founded the Gilbertine order. Other members of the bishop's household were Ralph Gubion, who became abbot of St Albans, and an Italian Bible scholar named Guido or Wido, who taught that subject while serving Alexander.Alexander presided over the organisation of his diocese into prebends to support the cathedral clergy; he established at least one new prebend and augmented two others. He also attended the church councils in 1127 and 1129 that were convened by William de Corbeil, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Later, during 1133 and 1134, he and the archbishop quarrelled, but the exact nature of their dispute is unknown. William and Alexander travelled to Normandy in 1134 to seek out King Henry to settle their dispute.\n\n\n== Reign of Stephen ==\n\nAfter Henry's death in 1135 the succession was disputed between the king's nephews\u2014Stephen and his elder brother Theobald II, Count of Champagne\u2014and Henry's surviving legitimate child Matilda, usually known as the Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V. King Henry's only legitimate son, William, had died in 1120. After Matilda was widowed in 1125 she returned to her father, who married her to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry's heir, but after Henry I's death in 1135 Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned, before Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. But Matilda was less sanguine and secured the support of the Scottish king, David, her maternal uncle, and in 1138 that of her half-brother, Robert, Earl of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of Henry I.The election of Theobald of Bec to the Archbishopric of Canterbury was announced at the Council of Westminster in 1138. The medieval chronicler Gervase of Canterbury writes that 17 bishops attended the council, which implies that Alexander was present. After a failed expedition to Normandy in 1137, the influence of Alexander's uncle, Roger of Salisbury, waned at the court of King Stephen, but the king took no action against the family that might incite them to rebel. In early 1139 Stephen may have named William d'Aubigny as Earl of Lincoln, perhaps in an effort to limit Alexander's influence in Lincolnshire.In June 1139 a knight was killed during a fight in Oxford between a party of Roger of Salisbury's men and a group of noblemen. The king ordered Roger to attend his court to explain the circumstances of the incident and to surrender custody of his castles, which Roger refused to do, resulting in his and Alexander's arrest; Roger's other nephew, Nigel, evaded capture. Another possible explanation for the arrests is offered by the Gesta Stephani, a contemporary chronicle, which reported the king's fear that Roger and his nephews were plotting to hand their castles to the Empress Matilda. Stephen may alternatively have been attempting to assert his rights over the castles, and demonstrate his authority over powerful subjects. Alexander was imprisoned in Oxford, in conditions described by some medieval chroniclers as bad.Since the work of Henry of Huntingdon, who wrote in the years before 1154 and who regarded Stephen's actions as treachery against the clergy that earned him punishment from God, Alexander's arrest has been seen by many historians as a turning point in Stephen's reign. Writing in the 1870s, the historian William Stubbs felt that the arrest destroyed the royal administration, but modern historians have advanced differing explanations for the troubles that followed, not all of which are related to the bishop's arrest.After Roger and Alexander's arrests Nigel defied the king. The bishops' castles refused to surrender to the king, therefore Stephen threatened to starve Alexander and Roger until they did. Sleaford and Newark surrendered and were given into the custody of Robert, the Earl of Leicester. Earl Robert also seized some of Lincoln's episcopal estates that had been disputed between the earl and the bishop. Alexander subsequently excommunicated Earl Robert when the earl refused to return the castle to Alexander's custody. Alexander then successfully applied to Pope Innocent II in 1139 for support in his efforts to recover Newark castle from Earl Robert.Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester and one of the king's main supporters, had recently been appointed papal legate. Henry objected to Stephen's actions in arresting the bishops and confiscating their property, as they were in contravention of canon law. Henry called a legatine council, a church council convened by a papal legate, at Winchester to discuss the issue, which ended in nothing being done, although both sides threatened excommunication and stated they would appeal to Rome and the papacy for support. Alexander did not attend the council of Winchester, but his uncle did. He seems to have borne Stephen no ill will over the arrest, and worked with the king during Stephen's later reign.In 1141 Alexander and the citizens of the town of Lincoln requested that Stephen come to Lincoln and intercede with Ranulf de Gernon, the Earl of Chester, who was attempting to enforce what he regarded as his rights to Lincoln Castle. Stephen arrived and besieged Ranulf's wife and half-brother in the castle, but the earl escaped and sought aid from Robert of Gloucester, Matilda's half-brother and leading supporter. Following Robert's arrival in Lincoln a battle took place there on 2 February 1141, during which Stephen was captured by Matilda's forces. Alexander was present at Oxford in July 1141, when the Empress Matilda held court and attempted to consolidate her hold on England. The citizens of London objected to Matilda's rule when she arrived in their city, and drove her away; Robert of Gloucester was captured shortly afterwards. This reversal of the Empress' fortunes resulted in Stephen's release, after he was exchanged for Robert. The next few years, until 1148, saw a period of civil war in England, often called The Anarchy, when neither Matilda nor Stephen controlled the country.\n\n\n== Patronage ==\n\nAlexander was a supporter of Gilbert of Sempringham's new monastic order of the Gilbertines, and he was also known as a patron of literature. He commissioned Geoffrey of Monmouth to compose the Prophecies of Merlin, which Geoffrey dedicated to him. Alexander was a patron of the medieval chronicler Henry of Huntingdon, and requested that Henry write his historical work.Alexander rebuilt Lincoln Cathedral after it had been destroyed by fire at an unknown date. He had the roof done with stone vaulting and began construction of the west front of the cathedral, which was finished under his successor. The only remaining major traces of Alexander's work on the west end are the carved doors and the frieze on the west front. The author of the Gesta Stephani claimed that Alexander's additions made Lincoln Cathedral \"

They were the brothers of the Bahila tribe. Throughout their history, they were a relatively small tribe compared to the other subtribes of Qays.\n\n\n=== Pre-Islamic era ===\nIn the mid-6th century a leader of the Banu Ghani, Riyah ibn Ashall, killed the son of the powerful chieftain of the Banu Abs, Zuhayr ibn Jadhima. His daughter was later wed to the founder of the paramount clan of the Banu 'Amir, Ja\u2019far ibn Kilab. From then onward, the Banu Ghani acted as subordinate allies of the Banu Amir, victoriously fighting alongside them at the battle of Shi\u2019b in 580 and the battle of Raqam toward the close of the century. However, they suffered heavy casualties alongside the Banu 'Amir subtribes of Banu Kilab and Banu Ka'b at the hands of the Banu Tayy at the battle of Muhajjar in the early 7th century. They later retaliated against the Tayy.\n\n\n=== Islamic era ===\nThough one member of the tribe, Abu Marthad al-Ghanawi, was an early companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, most of the tribe converted after the defeat of the pagan Arab tribes at the Battle of Hunayn in 630. They remained Muslim when many of the converted Arab tribes apostatized during the Ridda wars following Muhammad's death in 632. Many Ghani tribesmen migrated to Syria during the Muslim conquest of the region between 634 and 638. Following the rout of the Qaysi tribes at the Battle of Marj Rahit in 684, the Qaysi\u2013Yamani wars ensued. During the long-running conflict, the Banu Ghani fought alongside their Qaysi kinsmen against the Yamani tribes and the Taghlib.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nF\u00fcck, J. W.

A spacecraft launched as part of the Venera programme, Kosmos 167 was intended to land on Venus but never departed low Earth orbit due to a launch failure.\nBeginning in 1962, the name Kosmos was given to Soviet spacecraft which remained in Earth orbit, regardless of whether that was their intended final destination. The designation of this mission as an intended planetary probe is based on evidence from Soviet and non-Soviet sources and historical documents. Typically, Soviet planetary missions were initially put into an Earth parking orbit as a launch platform with a rocket engine and attached probe. The probes were then launched toward their targets with an engine burn with a duration of roughly 4 minutes. If the engine misfired or the burn was not completed, the probes would be left in Earth orbit and given a Kosmos designation.\n\n\n== Spacecraft ==\nThe 4V-1 No.311 spacecraft was the second of two 4V-1 vehicles built and operated by GSMZ Lavochkin, following Venera 4.\n\n\n== Mission ==\nA Molniya-M carrier rocket was used to launch the spacecraft. The launch occurred from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 02:36:38 GMT on 17 June 1967. This mission was intended to be a Venus lander, similar in design to the Venera 4 spacecraft. The spacecraft became stranded in Earth orbit when its Blok VL, fourth stage (trans-interplanetary stage), failed to fire because the engine's turbopump had not been cooled prior to ignition, never departed its parking orbit, and was designated Kosmos 167. The spacecraft reentered on 25 June 1967. It was deployed into a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 187 kilometres (116 mi), an apogee of 286 kilometres (178 mi), an inclination of 51.8\u00b0 to the equator, and orbital period of 89.2 minutes. It would have received the next designation in the Venera series, at the time Venera 5.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of missions to Venus\n\n\n== References =="

"Richard_Commission| Senedd| ","The Commission on the Powers and Electoral Arrangements of the National Assembly for Wales, known unofficially as The Richard Commission, was established in July 2002 by the First Minister of the National Assembly for Wales, now known as the Senedd. Ivor Richard, Baron Richard was appointed to chair the Commission. Richard was joined by five Commissioners appointed following open competition and interview, as well as four commissioners nominated jointly by the four party leaders in the first Assembly.The purpose of the Commission was examine the powers and electoral arrangements of the National Assembly and to remit its findings in an independent report. The report was intended to contribute to decisions on the future of the National Assembly and the way Wales was to be governed.The Commission published its report in March 2004. It recommended that the National Assembly should have powers to legislate in certain areas, whilst others would remain the preserve of Westminster. It also recommended changing the electoral system to the single transferable vote (STV) which would produce greater proportionality.\nThe Commission did not evaluate the performance of the Assembly or the Welsh Assembly Government. The Commission viewed that would have involved going outside the terms of reference and making subjective judgments.\nIn response, the British government, in its Better Governance for Wales White Paper, published on 15 June 2005, proposed a more permissive law-making system for the Welsh Assembly based on the use of Parliamentary Orders in Council. In so doing, the Government rejected many of the cross party Richard Commission's recommendations. This has attracted criticism from opposition parties and others.\n\n\n== Commission's membership ==\nIvor Richard, Baron Richard, previously Leader of the House of Lords, EEC Commissioner, Member of Parliament and UK Ambassador to the United Nations.\nTom Jones, farmer from Welshpool, Powys.

The newspaper, owned by Chen Fan and edited by Zhang Shizhao of the Patriotic Study Society, was being published in January 1900. It advocated reform and radicalism and supported the Patriotic Academy. Su Bao was closed down by the authorities in 1903.\n\n\n== Suppression ==\nIn the summer of 1903, Su Bao was suppressed. It had published a series of articles about overthrowing the monarchy and realizing republicanism. At that time the pioneer of democratic revolution minister, Zou Rong, published Revolutionary Army. Su Bao not only published the description of Revolutionary Army written by Zou Rong, the Preface of Revolutionary Army, written by Zhang Binglin, and Introduction of Revolution Army, written by Zhang Shizhao, but also spoke highly of them. \nOn June 29, Su Bao published another article, The Relationship between Kang Youwei and Sir Jue Luo, which not only opposed Kang Youwei for his opinion of supporting constitution and refusing revolution, but also challenged Emperor Guangxu and Empress Dowager Cixi. On the same day that the article was published, foreign concession government arrested Zhang Binglin and Zou Rong, and then closed down the newspaper. The Qing government was urged to execute Zhang Binglin and Zou Rong. However, because of huge social pressure, the concession areas sentenced them to life imprisonment in their first trial. Afterwards the authorities were forced to change the sentence of Zhang Binglin to three years and that of Zou Rong to two years.\n\n\n== Significance ==\nThe case is memorable in Chinese newspaper history. The feudal class never allowed speeches of offence to governors in order to maintain authoritarian rules. They used literary inquisition as their weapon to control those who dared to say something, especially in Qing and Ming Dynasty. Since modern times when newspapers came into being, rulers were trying to suppress and control them. Su Bao case showed a conflict between feudal rulers and modern progressive thought, and may be the oldest and most typical literary inquisition in the press during the history of China.\n\n\n== References =="

Ibn Daud wrote:\n\nThen King Charles sent to the King of Baghdad [Caliph] requesting that he dispatch one of his Jews of the seed of royalty of the House of David. He hearkened and sent him one from there, a magnate and sage, Rabbi Makhir by name. And [Charles] settled him in Narbonne, the capital city, and planted him there, and gave him a great possession there at the time he captured it from the Ishmaelites [Arabs]. And he [Makhir] took to wife a woman from among the magnates of the town; *...* and the King made him a nobleman and designed, out of love for [Makhir], good statutes for the benefit of all the Jews dwelling in the city, as is written and sealed in a Latin charter; and the seal of the King therein [bears] his name Carolus; and it is in their possession at the present time. The Prince Makhir became chieftain there. He and his descendants were close [inter-related] with the King and all his descendants.Whatever Makhir's Babylon origins claimed by his descendants, the relation between Makhir and Charlemagne is legendary, the more famous king substituting for his father Pepin, king of the Franks, who in order to enlist the Jews of Narbonne in his efforts to keep the Ummayad Saracens at bay, granted wide-ranging powers in return for the surrender of Moorish Narbonne to him in 759. The Annals of Aniane and the Chronicle of Moissac both attribute this action to the Gothic leaders of Narbonne, rising up and massacring the Saracen garrison. Pepin with his sons Carloman and Charles redeemed this pledge in 768, granting to Makhir and his heirs extensive lands, an act that called forth an unavailing protest from Pope Stephen III. In 791 Charlemagne confirmed the status of the Jewish Principate and made the title of Nasi permanent.The Makhir family enjoyed for centuries many privileges and that its members bore the title of \"

"Exclaustration| Organisation of Catholic religious orders| Catholic canon law of religious| ","In the canon law of the Catholic Church, exclaustration is the official authorization for a member of a religious order (in short, a religious) bound by perpetual vows to live for a limited time outside their religious institute, usually with a view to discerning whether to depart definitively.\n\n\n== Distinctions ==\nExclaustration is distinguished from permission to live outside of a religious community for purposes such as caring for a parent or for reasons of work or study. The religious who in such circumstances is forced to be absent physically does not wish to separate even temporarily from the institute.Exclaustration is distinguished also from dispensation from religious vows. The exclaustrated religious remains a religious and remains bound by those vows, although the manner of exercising poverty and obedience is altered in view of the changed circumstances.A religious bound by temporary vows may for a grave reason be authorized to leave before expiry of the period for which the vows were taken. This authorization is called an indult of departure, not an exclaustration. Unless the religious rejects it, an indult of departure entails dispensation from the religious vows that have been taken.\n\n\n== Clergy ==\nIf the religious who is to be exclaustrated is a deacon or priest, he must first obtain the consent of the local ordinary (diocesan bishop or the equivalent in law of a diocesan bishop, such as an apostolic prefect) of the place where he intends to reside. Such residence may serve as a first step towards incardination into the jurisdiction of the ordinary. Agreement must be made with the local ordinary about any exercise of sacred ministry by the religious during the period of exclaustration.\n\n\n=== Experimental and qualified exclaustration ===\nIn addition to ordinary or simple exclaustration, as described above, the Holy See, but not the religious superior or the diocesan bishop, may grant what has been called an exclaustration ad experimentum to a religious priest who has definitively decided to leave his institute and become a diocesan priest and who has found a diocesan bishop willing to accept him on a trial basis. This has the additional effect that he will be automatically released from his religious vows and incardinated into the diocese when the bishop decides to accept him definitively or, provided the bishop has not rejected him before then, at the close of a five-year trial period.If a diocesan bishop is willing to incardinate a religious priest immediately, there is no need for exclaustration, and secularization (dispensation from the religious vows) is granted instead.In certain situations where a religious priest does not intend to become a diocesan priest, the Holy See has sometimes granted what has been called \"

According to the contemporary chronicles, Malatesta designed it, although it is known that several architects worked on the construction, including Filippo Brunelleschi, who visited Rimini for two months in 1438. Construction lasted some 15 years.\nThe castle-palace originally was surrounded by a large moat, with a ravelin at the main entrance, sporting the heraldic symbols of the House of Malatesta. The walls were thought to be thick enough to bear the impact of the new artillery pieces of that period. Although originally positioned externally from the city, it has no towers facing that side: all towers are in fact oriented towards the city. These towers are square, and once housed a bronze cannon each.\nThe central part of the castle was also the Malatesta residence, with rooms decorated with tapestries, curtains and frescoes. Also the exterior was decorated, as suggested by the few maiolica tiles visible. Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta died here in 1468.\nIn 1821 the castle was turned into barracks for the local Carabinieri. Five years later, the external walls were demolished and the moat filled. After a period of decline, the edifice is now used for cultural exhibitions.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPage at www.riminiturismo.it (in Italian and English)"

Williams), but no printed libretto, is found in British Library.  The score contains all the dialogue.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWhen the Gilbert and Sullivan partnership disbanded after the production of The Gondoliers in 1889, the impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte filled the Savoy Theatre with a combination of new works and revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.  The fashion in the late Victorian era was to present long evenings in the theatre, and so producer Richard D'Oyly Carte preceded his Savoy operas with curtain raisers.  W. J. MacQueen-Pope commented, concerning such curtain raisers:\n\nThis was a one-act play, seen only by the early comers.  It would play to empty boxes, half-empty upper circle, to a gradually filling stalls and dress circle, but to an attentive, grateful and appreciative pit and gallery.  Often these plays were little gems.  They deserved much better treatment than they got, but those who saw them delighted in them. ...  [They] served to give young actors and actresses a chance to win their spurs ... the stalls and the boxes lost much by missing the curtain-raiser, but to them dinner was more important.To create Old Sarah, Carte selected two artists who he knew could deliver a good piece.  Cellier was the long-time music director of the Savoy Theatre and had produced other works for Carte.  Greenbank was also a known quantity, first for having supplied the theatre with two other curtain raisers, Captain Billy (1891) and Mr. Jericho (1893).  In addition, by this time, Greenbank's reputation was well established, having supplied lyrics for a number of hit musicals, including A Gaiety Girl (1893), An Artist's Model (1895), The Geisha (1896), and The Circus Girl (1896).\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIn Dullport, a dreary seaside town, out of season, Old Sarah sells sweets from a stall.

"Leiper_Railroad| Railway lines opened in 1810| Horse-drawn railways| Railway lines closed in 1828| Companies based in Philadelphia| Defunct Pennsylvania railroads| ","The Leiper Railroad was a 'family business built' horse drawn railroad of three quarters of a mile constructed in 1810 after the quarry owner, Thomas Leiper, failed to obtain a charter with legal rights-of-way to instead build his desired canal along Crum Creek.  The quarry man's 'make-do' railroad was the continent's first chartered railway, first operational non-temporary railway, first well-documented railroad, and first constructed railroad also meant to be permanent.\n\nThe credit of constructing the first permanent tramway in America may therefore be rightly given to Thomas Leiper. He was the owner of a fine quarry not far from Philadelphia, and was much concerned to find an easy mode of carrying stone to tide-water. That a railway would accomplish this end he seem to have had no doubt. To test the matter, and at the same time afford a public exhibition of the merits of tramways, he built a temporary track in the yard of the Bull's Head Tavern in Philadelphia. The tramway was some sixty feet long, had a grade of one inch and a half to the yard, and up it, to the amazement of the spectators, one horse used to draw a four-wheeled wagon loaded with a weight of ten thousand pounds. This was the summer of 1809. Before autumn laborers were at work building a railway from the quarry to the nearest landing, a distance of three quarters of a mile. In the spring of 1810 the road began to be used and continued in using during eighteen years. by John Bach McMaster, page 494, A History of the People of the United States, from the Revolution to the Civil War\n\n\n== Leiper ==\nThomas Leiper was a Pennsylvania Militia officer who served during several campaign years, first failing to obtain allowance to build a canal connecting his quarry near Crum Creek to Ridley Creek, reaching flood-waters on the estuary of the Delaware Valley tidewater in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. \nFirst, he commissioned a short experimental horse-powered railway in 1809 which proved a horse-drawn heavy wagon heavily loaded could advance successfully against a stiff gradient a bit over 4%. The track, with a 4 feet (1.2 m) gauge, had a grade of 1-1/2 inch to the yard (1 : 24 or about 4%) over its total length of 60 yards (54.9 m) and proves satisfactory when tested with a loaded car.  The test track had created quite a scene, so it and the railway begun that year was both studied by nearby Penn students and professors, and was much covered in the press \u2014 when the permanent railroad began operations, it was on every-day operational display in the nation's largest, and most industrialized city.  \nIt operated regularly as a private carrier between 1810 and 1828 in what is now Nether Providence Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, a short distance away from the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) within Philadelphia itself, so the railroad became the first 'meant to be permanent' and documented railway in North America, and first built by civilians.  Ironically, when an 1824 petition finally succeeded, the railroad was replaced by the 'long desired canal' just as the world elsewhere was turning to and regularly were considering adopting railways for movement of heavy and bulk goods, as well as people. Then, in 1852, the railway was reopened and it replaced in turn, the Leiper Canal.\n\n\n== Historical context ==\nIn the 1930s, a Harvard economics study observed that post Revolutionary War towns throughout the country experienced phenomenal growth rates, citing 133% per decade as a sustained average growth rate, that continued into the 1920s.  This means, for every 1000 citizens, ten years later there were 2330 by the decade's end. \nFrom the start of the 1880s, most of the well known, or the individuals commonly thought of as our country's founding fathers, as well as many lesser known men of means and affairs had focused on transportation as being a problem. The 13 colonies had saturated the riverine valleys so far as they would support agrarian life-styles in vogue for the times, and industry was building only slowly but blocked by lack of fuels and worse, lack of means to transport it the tens or hundreds of miles it need come if a foundry or mill were to make use of it.\nHence, after the mid-1780s, the historical record shows repeated petitions to allow river improvements or charters for turnpikes and toll roads, so historians can correctly paint the era as either the canal age or the turnpike age.  In 1793, the engineers of the Middlesex Canal, located a hydraulic cement and generally showed the way forward, and for the next several decades, canals to support commerce such as the Delaware and Hudson Canal, the Potomack Canal, the Raritan, the Morris, or the more famous Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, Lehigh Canal, Schuylkill Canal and Erie Canal & Illinois Canals all cheapened long distance shipping, spurred commerce, and enabled the industrial revolution, including the production of enough iron to make railroads to create their own assassins.\nAs the Leiper Canal was being constructed, a number of other railroad projects of far more ambitious scope were taking the field:\n\nPennsylvania's second charter was included in the Main Line of Public Works legislation, authorizing the Allegheny Portage Railroad which intended to crawl over the Alleghenies with barges on a railroad,\nwhile in New Jersey, John Stevens built a test track in 1825 to experimentally settle the great traction debate and runs a steam locomotive around it in his summer home estate, Hoboken, New Jersey. In 1830, this would result in the Camden and Amboy Railroad incorporation and charter to connect New York harbor with Philadelphia-Trenton by fast railcar service, the first railroad to be 'focused first' on passenger traffic, with the competitive aim of taking on lucrative stagecoach services.\nPennsylvania's second private charter was given to the Delaware and Hudson Gravity Railroad (c.1826, o:1830),\nwhereas the Commonwealth of Massachusetts over chartered the Leiper Railroad's soulmate: the 3 miles (4.8 km) industrial animal powered Granite Railroad opened in Quincy, Massachusetts, to convey quarried granite for the Bunker Hill monument. It later becomes a common carrier railroad and lasted into the 20th century.\nIn the meantime, New York chartered the 16-mile route between Albany and Schenectady for the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad on April 17, 1826 (c.1826, o:1831), based on the idea it was better to travel an hour instead of a day circuitously on the canal around a waterfall.\nand in 1827 the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company built and began operating the 9 miles (14 km) Summit Hill and Mauch Chunk Railroad, while also in 1827, Maryland and Virginia clear needs and issue the charter and rights-of-ways for the ambitious Baltimore and Ohio:\u200a21\u200a \u2014 which becomes the (3rd or 4th) next operational railroad (depending upon how Liepers' withdrawal is counted and scored), running tests in 1829 about the time Leiper and Son are shifting from rail to canal and\nThe Stourbridge Lion, first steam locomotive imported into the USA, is tested along tracks built by the Delaware and Hudson company on August 8, 1829.  Deemed too heavy for the company's rails, it and its three brethren are converted to stationary engines.\n1830 ushers in a flurry of transportation (railroad & canal) incorporations, charter applications, grants and beginnings of construction, and completions of construction and partial or full railway openings.\nThe American built\nThe B&O opens its first 13 miles (21 km) stretch to Ellicott's Mills and begins regular scheduled passenger services on schedule, May 24, 1830.\n1830 the 26 miles (42 km) Beaver Meadows Railroad from Beaver Meadows, Pennsylvania, is incorporated and construction commenced to open a second major coal field to the Lehigh Canal at a second loading facility in Parryville beyond the Lehigh Gap\u2014this offered a more efficient use of the canal with out jamming up the Summit Hill & Mauch Chunk. This would form the seed company of the first class Lehigh Valley Railroad after the 1870s.Built two decades into the brief American canal age, it ran about 3 miles (5 km) along Crum Creek in Delaware County to its mouth in Eastern Pennsylvania's Delaware Valley.  After rights to build the canal were initially denied, for 18 years a horse-drawn industrial railroad, the Leiper Railroad, was used to carry stone products from the quarry to the Delaware dock before the opening of the canal.  Located close to the University of Pennsylvania, one historian has opined that the idea was not Leiper's but belonged to TBDL and found, who became a noted engineer and steam locomotive builder.\nThe tramway became a shortline branch of the B&O railroad in the 1880s.\nCrum Creek's mouth is located at 39\u00b051\u203228\u2033N 75\u00b019\u203214\u2033W.Efforts were made in the 1930s to preserve the remnants of the railroad. The Thomas Leiper Estate was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.

Players work together over a twelve game campaign to build a village, while simultaneously competing to win each game, and ultimately win the campaign. \nPlayers build buildings, score objectives, and spend money to open crates, which add new rules, buildings, and special abilities to the game. When the campaign is finished, players will have a uniquely developed copy of the final game which can then be played thenceforth.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nAt the beginning of the first game, there are six buildings on the board, and players each have two meeples, which they can place on the buildings to collect some of the game's six different resources. These resources can be used to permanently add new buildings to the board in the form of adhesive stickers, which add new actions to the game which the players can take. Players gain points to win each game by building buildings, achieving certain predetermined objectives, paying money to open crates, and spending influence to move up a reputation track.\nOpening crates also unlocks new rules and special abilities, and the players also gain new abilities from special cards they acquire each game. The game board and rules develop uniquely depending on the choices made by the players, so that by the end of a twelve game campaign, each copy of Charterstone has developed into a different permanent game.\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\nResponse to the game has been mostly positive, with reviewers praising the satisfying complex layers of new elements the game ongoingly introduces, but noting that the game is slow to reveal its secrets, and can seem plodding in the early stages of the campaign.Matt Thrower writing for IGN stated that \"

The strike began on 13 October 1969 and lasted for roughly two weeks, with some pits returning to work before others.  The NCB lost \u00a315 million and 2.5 million tonnes of coal as a result of the strike.\n\n\n== Context ==\nAt the time of the strike, wage negotiations were underway between the NCB and the National Union of Mineworkers.  Although that was not the cause of the dispute, it became essential to the settlement of the dispute.  In the 1960s, employment in coal mining had fallen by almost 400,000 with little resistance from the NUM leadership, but the left wing of the union was becoming stronger and drawing strength from the students' protests. When miners staged a protest in London to support their wage claim, many Londoners were surprised that there were still coal mines operating in Britain. The NUM leadership of Sidney Ford was regarded by many within the union as having been too passive and accommodating of a Labour government.\n\n\n== Cause ==\nThe cause was the hours of work for surface workers, who were often older mineworkers who were no longer capable of working underground. Wages were lower, and working hours were longer for surface work than for underground work. The annual conference of the NUM had voted in July 1968 to demand the surface workers' hours be lowered to seven and three-quarters, but the union's executive had not acted upon the vote.\n\n\n== Sequence of events ==\nOn 11 October, Arthur Scargill led a group of Yorkshire mineworkers in pushing for action at the Yorkshire NUM's area council. The president of the Yorkshire NUM, Sam Bullogh, was unwell at the time and ruled Scargill \"

"Martin-Baker_Mk.2| Martin-Baker ejection seats| ","The Martin-Baker Mk.2 is a British ejection seat designed and built by Martin-Baker. Introduced in the early 1950s, the Mk.2 was developed from the Martin-Baker Mk.1, the main improvement being automatic seat separation and parachute deployment.A development of the seat with a longer-stroke ejection gun, duplex drogue and leg restraints was the Martin-Baker Mk.3.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Mk.2 seat was designed as an improved version of the first Martin-Baker seat. Improvements included relocation of the  main parachute and dinghy, automatic parachute deployment and man/seat separation systems to assist incapacitated crews . During 1953 Mk.1 seats in service were modified to Mk.2 standard. The first successful ejection using a Mk.2 seat took place on 15 May 1953, the aircraft involved being a Supermarine Attacker operating from HMS Eagle.\n\n\n== Operation sequence ==\nOperating the face blind firing handle initiates firing of the main gun located at the rear of the seat, the main gun is a telescopic tube with two explosive charges that fire in sequence. As the seat moves up its guide rails an emergency oxygen supply is activated and personal equipment tubing and communication leads are automatically disconnected.A steel rod, known as the drogue gun, is fired and extracts two small drogue parachutes to stabilise the seat's descent path. A barostatic mechanism prevents the main parachute from opening above an altitude of 10,000 ft (3,000 m) A time delay mechanism operates the main parachute below this altitude, the seat then separates from the occupant for a normal parachute descent, a manual separation handle and ripcord is provided should the automatic system fail.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nThe Mk.2 ejection seat has been installed in the following aircraft types:\nList from Martin-Baker.\nAvro Canada CF-100 Canuck\nde Havilland Venom\nEnglish Electric Canberra\nGloster Meteor\nHawker Hunter\nHawker Sea Hawk\nSupermarine Attacker\nSupermarine Swift\nWestland Wyvern\n\n\n== Seats on display ==\nA Martin-Baker Mk.2 seat is on display at the Midland Air Museum.\n\n\n== Specifications (Mk.2) ==\nMaximum operating speed: 400 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS)\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"

He served during the American Revolutionary, the French Revolutionary and the Napoleonic Wars, rising to the rank of Captain.\n\n\n== Family and early life ==\nMounsey was born in 1766, as the fifth son of George Mounsey, of Carlisle. He joined the navy on 23 February 1780, at the age of 13, becoming a midshipman aboard HMS Royal Oak, under Captain Sir Digby Dent, who would become Mounsey's patron. The Royal Oak was sent to the North American Station in May to reinforce Vice-admiral Mariot Arbuthnot's fleet. During the voyage Mounsey took part in the capture of a French East Indiaman. They reached their destination on 13 July, after which Arbuthnot raised his flag aboard the Royal Oak, whilst Dent and Mounsey moved aboard HMS Raisonnable. The Raisonnable then returned home with despatches, but the ship was so badly damaged by a gale whilst crossing the Atlantic, that she was paid off on her arrival for large-scale repairs. Dent and Mounsey transferred again, this time to HMS Repulse, initially under Vice-Admiral George Darby, but later being detached to land stores at Gibraltar in April 1781.Dent and Mounsey were transferred again at the end of the year, this time to the third rate HMS Cumberland. Dent retired about this time due to ill-health, with Captain William Allen. Mounsey and the Cumberland sailed to the East Indies on 6 February 1782, joining the squadron there under Sir Richard Bickerton. They were in time to see action at the Battle of Cuddalore, between Sir Edward Hughes and the Bailli de Suffren. Cumberland had two killed and 11 wounded in the battle, fought on 20 June 1783.  Mounsey returned to England in May 1784, becoming midshipman aboard the sloop HMS Orestes. He passed his lieutenant's examination on 3 December 1788, and went on to serve aboard HMS Arethusa, HMS Victory, HMS Duke and HMS Juno.\n\n\n== Lieutenancy and promotions ==\nWith the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, Mounsey returned to HMS Victory, then under Admiral Lord Hood. He was promoted to lieutenant on 22 May 1793, and appointed to HMS Ardent, under Robert Manners-Sutton, and then to the frigate HMS Lowestoffe. He was present at the occupation of Toulon, and at numerous assaults during the capture of Corsica. Whilst blockading Bastia, he led a dangerous attempt to cut-out a vessel laden with gunpowder, lying the harbour. Mounsey was successful, and the loss of the ship accelerate the fall of the city. He returned to Britain aboard HMS Imperieuse, and was afterwards appointed to HMS Trident, HMS Impregnable, HMS Duke, HMS Defiance and HMS Clyde in succession. On 6 July 1801 he led the boats from Clyde and her escorts to destroy the beached wreck of HMS Jason, coming under heavy fire as they did so. Mounsey remained aboard HMS Clyde until being promoted to commander on 29 April 1802. He was appointed on 17 May 1802 to command of the sloop Rosario. During his time aboard her he was tasked with carrying despatches, reconnoitering enemy positions, escorting convoys, and conducting anti-smuggling patrols. Also during this period he captured a number of enemy merchants, as well as a 22-gun privateer.\n\n\n== HMS Bonne Citoyenne and the Furieuse ==\n\nHe left the Rosario in autumn 1808, and on 18 April 1809, he was appointed to the 20-gun HMS Bonne Citoyenne. He was sent with despatches for Earl St Vincent then at Lisbon. He returned to England after completing this, and on 18 June sailed from Spithead in company with HMS Inflexible. The two were acting as escorts for a convoy bound for Quebec. Whilst travelling with the convoy on 2 July, a suspicious sail was sighted astern, and Mounsey dropped back to investigate. In doing so he lost sight of the convoy and in sailing to rejoin them, came across a French frigate on 5 July, which was in the process of capturing an English merchant. Despite the much larger size of the frigate, Mounsey immediately gave chase, at which the French ship fled northwards. After a chase lasting 18 hours the Bonne Citoyenne caught up with the French ship on the morning of 6 July and brought her to battle. The subsequent engagement lasted seven hours, with Bonne Citoyenne at a disadvantage early on, when three of her guns were dismounted. She nevertheless fired 129 broadsides to the enemy's 70. By the end of the battle Bonne Citoyenne had lost her top masts, her lower masts were badly damaged, and her rigging, sails and boats had been shot to pieces. Running out of powder Mounsey decided to force the issue and ordered his men to be prepared to board the French ship. Before he could do so, the French surrendered and Mounsey took possession.\n\nThe enemy ship was discovered to be the Furieuse, which had sailed from the \u00celes des Saintes on 1 April, carrying sugar and coffee to France. She was capable of carrying 48 guns, but was only carrying 20 at the time. Despite this she had a much larger crew, with 200 sailors, 40 soldiers, and a detachment of troops from the 60th regiment of the line. She had suffered heavy damage, with her masts shot away, five feet of water in the hold and 35 killed and 37 wounded. In contrast, Bonne Citoyenne had just one man killed and five wounded. The frigate was patched up and towed into Halifax, where both were repaired. The captured frigate was later commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Furieuse, whilst the Bonne Citoyenne returned to England in September.\nThe capture of the Furieuse was hailed as a great victory.  Henry Phipps, First Lord of the Admiralty wrote to Mounsey Sir, - I did not fail this day, to lay before his Majesty the particulars of your conduct in the attack and capture of the Furieuse, French frigate, on 6 July. The enterprising gallantry with which you approached and attack a ship bearing such an appearance of a commanding superiority of force, and the skill, courage, and perseverance manifested by you, and the officers, seamen, and marines under your command, during an action of such long continuance, and so warmly contested, have received his Majesty's fullest approbation...\nA round of promotions followed the victory, the first lieutenant was promoted to commander and Mounsey was promoted to post captain. He was offered command of the Furieuse, once she had been repaired, which he accepted, taking command on her commissioning in November 1811.\n\n\n== Command of the Furieuse ==\nMounsey and the Furieuse were initially employed in escorting a convoy to the Mediterranean, after which she joined the fleet blockading Toulon under Admiral Edward Pellew. The French fleet sailed out in May 1812, consisting of 12 sail of the line and seven frigates, of which one ship of the line and two frigates began to chase the British inshore squadron, consisting of the Furieuse, and the frigates HMS Menelaus and HMS Havannah, and the brig HMS Pelorus. The French gave up the chase when the British made clear their intention to fight.On 9 November 1812 Mounsey captured the French privateer Nebrophonus, and on 10 January 1813 captured the privateer Argus. In February 1813 Mounsey supported Charles John Napier in HMS Thames in the capture of the island of Ponza. They landed troops on 26 February, under fire from shore batteries, which soon subdued resistance. The capture of the harbour eliminated an infamous corsair haven, and provided an anchorage for Royal Navy ships watching Naples. On 7 May boats from Furieuse captured the French Conception, towing her out to sea under heavy fire. One man was killed and another five wounded in this operation. On 4 October a convoy was sighted off Civitavecchia. Despite being heavily protected by two gunboats and a number of shore batteries, an operation was attempted. Marines from Furieuse's boats stormed and captured a fort, under cover from Furieuse's guns. The enemy retreated to a nearby castle and continued to fire on the British forces. Nevertheless, the British were able to sink the gunboats, and bring out 16 of the merchant ships. The Furieuse kept up a steady fire, preventing reinforcements from Civitavecchia from intervening. Two of the British party were killed and 10 wounded in the operation.For the rest of 1813 Furieuse formed part of Admiral Sir Josias Rowley's squadron, and was present at the capture of Via Reggio, and the unsuccessful assault on Livorno in December. In early March 1814, still with Rowley, Furieuse assisted in the occupation of La Spezia and the surrounding areas. On 17 April a squadron consisting of Furieuse, HMS Aboukir, HMS Iphigenia, HMS Swallow and HMS Cephalus supported the successful assault on Genoa. The end of the War of the Sixth Coalition in 1814 led to Furieuse transferring to the Caribbean, where she escorted transports. She conveyed the 62nd regiment to Halifax, and with the end of the War of 1812, remained in the area to support the troops.HMS Furieuse was paid off in autumn 1815 and was sold for breaking up in October 1816 at Deptford. Mounsey was nominated a Companion of the Order of the Bath in June 1815, and also received the Naval Gold Medal for the capture of the Furieuse. With the end of the wars with France he retired from active service, and died on 25 September 1830 at the age of 64.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nMarshall, John (1828). \"

She was the daughter of Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAldona married Casimir III of Poland, when he was 15 or 16 years old. The bride was probably of about the same age. The marriage took place on 30 April or 16 October 1325 and was a purely political maneuver to strengthen the first Polish\u2013Lithuanian coalition against the Teutonic Knights. Casimir was seeking allies in the dispute over Pomerania with the Order. Gediminas had just undertaken an unsuccessful attempt to Christianize Lithuania. This coalition was a prelude to the Union of Krewo in 1385, and the Union of Lublin in 1569, which resulted in the creation of a new state, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. The details of the agreement are not known; however, it is known that Gediminas released all Polish captives, some 25,000 people, who returned to Poland. The importance of the marriage was attested by the fact that W\u0142adys\u0142aw abandoned his earlier plans to marry his son to Jutta of Bohemia. The alliance was put into effect when joint Polish\u2013Lithuanian forces organized an attack against the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1326. However, the coalition was not strong and collapsed c. 1330. Yet, there is no evidence of fighting between Poland and Lithuania while Aldona was alive. Aldona died suddenly at the end of May 1339, and was buried in Krak\u00f3w.\nAldona was remembered for her piety and devotion to music. She was accompanied by court musicians wherever she went. It was even suggested by Jan D\u0142ugosz that the cymbals which were played in procession before her represented a pagan Lithuanian tradition. Her husband Casimir is known for his romantic affairs: after Aldona's death he married three more times. Aldona had two daughters:\n\nCunigunde of Poland (died in 1357); married on  1 January 1345 Louis VI the Roman, the son of Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor.\nElisabeth (1326\u20131361); married Bogislaus V, Duke of Pomerania.

"Primal_Integration| Psychotherapy| Humanistic psychology| ","Primal Integration (PI) is a form of personal growth work first formulated by the Canadian Bill Swartley in the mid-1970s. Unlike many other approaches known as psychotherapy, it puts the emphasis on an individual's self-directed exploration of their own  psyche assisted by facilitators who serve the individual and are responsible for their safety. It uses an educational model and is considered to be part of humanistic psychology. It has a different approach to the better known Primal therapy formulated by Arthur Janov and is not related to it except in the broadest sense by its name and by its acceptance of the significance of early  experiences.\n\n\n== Description ==\nDuring the late 1970s Swartley travelled in Europe and was instrumental in setting up centres for Primal Integration in Italy and Britain. Centres also exist in Canada and the USA.\nIts theoretical basis emphasizes early trauma in shaping an individual's consciousness. It claims that trauma that takes place before, during and soon after birth has strong influences on how someone interprets and copes with their future life. These early preverbal traumata, as well as later difficult childhood experiences, can only be fully recognized by re-living the experience at an emotional level. This emotional expression of deep memory is called a \"

"Potocytosis| Cellular processes| ","Potocytosis is a type of receptor-mediated endocytosis in which small molecules are transported across the plasma membrane of a cell. The molecules are transported by caveolae (rather than clathrin-coated vesicles) and are deposited directly into the cytosol.Like other types of receptor-mediated endocytosis, potocytosis typically begins when an extracellular ligand binds to a receptor protein on the surface of a cell, thus beginning the formation of an endocytotic vesicle. The ligand is usually of low molecular mass (e.g. vitamins), but some larger molecules (such as lipids) can also act as ligands.\n\n\n== Mechanism ==\nLipid rafts in the plasma membrane act  as membrane microdomains. They are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids and are involved potocytosis as the lateral compartmentalization of molecules. Caveolae are caveolin-1-enriched smooth invaginations found on these lipid rafts that contribute to transportation of molecules. Potocytosis works by taking up material into caveolae at the surface of the cell.  Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored class of membrane proteins generate high concentrations of molecules. This may either be by releasing a receptor bound molecule, by converting molecules enzymatically or by releasing them from a carrier protein.\n\n\n== References =="

Unlike in other Chatino-speaking towns, loudspeakers used for public announcements broadcast exclusively in Spanish. Spanish is the only language used for government, but Chatino-speaking officials use the language when no monolingual Spanish-speakers are present. Unlike other Chatino communities, ceremonies welcoming new officials to local government are conducted entirely in Spanish.\nChatino speakers know that their numbers are in decline, but there are some movements towards revitalization. There are signs of nostalgia among all community members for the language, including among the younger generation, and public events feature young Chatinos (typically semi-speakers) who are using the language in various ways.

The raid took place in the early morning hours of September 11, 1851, at the house in Christiana, Pennsylvania, of William Parker, himself an escaped slave. This took place after the federal Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 increased penalties for assisting escaped slaves and required state government officials, even in free states such as Pennsylvania, to assist in the recapture of slaves. \nThe confrontation resulted in an exchange of gunfire, the death of Edward Gorsuch, and the dispersal of the raiders. In the aftermath many of the Blacks involved quickly traveled to the safety of Canada. In total, 41 persons were indicted by the federal government for treason, including both Blacks and Whites. Castner Hanway, a white man from Christiana, was the first to be tried, beginning in November 1851. After only 15 minutes of deliberation by the jury he was acquitted, and charges against the remaining defendants were dropped. The issue became a national lightning rod, and aroused strong sectional sentiment. It was one of many events leading to the American Civil War.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the years before the abolition of slavery in the United States, slave-owners of the South pushed for increased federal and state government support for the recovery of escaped slaves. However, in the free states of the North, many residents and governments had resisted, especially given that in the free states many individuals or even state laws protected fleeing slaves.Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which permitted slave owners or their agents to pursue fugitive slaves in free states and required state officials to aid in the recapture of the alleged slaves. Those aiding an escaping slave could face six months' imprisonment and a $1,000 fine.In 1849 Edward Gorsuch, who farmed in Monkton, Maryland, owned twelve slaves.:\u200a4\u200a He considered himself a good slaveholder, freeing some of his slaves at the age of 28 and offering them paid seasonal work after that. With changes in crops and other conditions, slavery was no longer as necessary in Maryland, and there were a relatively high proportion of free blacks. Gorsuch did not sell his excess slaves to the Deep South as many other Maryland slave owners of the time did.:\u200a6\u200a Five bushels of wheat went missing, and Gorsuch was told that some of his slaves had stolen it.:\u200a10\u201311\u200a Four of his older male slaves, Noah Buley, Nelson Ford, George Hammond, and Joshua Hammond, fled north to Pennsylvania, a free state. Gorsuch believed that they had been enticed away and would willingly return if he only talked to them.:\u200a13\u200aChristiana, in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, is 20 miles (32 km) north of the border with Maryland and had become a refuge for fugitive slaves. It was also an area of settlement by numerous free Blacks. This area was frequently raided by slave catchers trying to capture refugee slaves. For two decades, local Blacks had organized for self-protection, at times preventing such capture or even rescuing slaves who had been captured.:\u200a46\u201347\u200a Others chose to flee to Canada.:\u200a46\u200a The leader of the resistance in 1851 was William Parker, an escaped slave about 29 years old.:\u200a161\u2013166\u200a:\u200a47\u201349\u200aIn Philadelphia, where warrants for the arrest of fugitive slaves in Pennsylvania were usually acquired at the federal court after the 1850 act was passed, another group, the Special Secret Committee, had organized to gather information and warn those being hunted.:\u200a53\u200a\n\n\n== Incident ==\n\nEdward Gorsuch heard that his four escaped slaves had taken refuge in Lancaster County. On September 9, 1851, in Philadelphia, he obtained a federal warrant under the Fugitive Slave Act for the arrest of George Hammond, Joshua Hammond, Nelson Ford, and Noah Buley. Henry Kline, a deputy Federal Marshall, was authorized to make the arrests.:\u200a52\u200a Gorsuch hired John Agan and Thompson Tully, Philadelphia police officers, to assist in the arrest.:\u200a53\u200a:\u200a277\u200a These three were to meet with Gorsuch and some additional men at Penningtonville (now Atglen,) a station on the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad.From Philadelphia the group had been watched by Samuel Williams, a member of the Special Secret Committee; he followed Kline and warned the Black community around Christiana that they were coming.:\u200a53\u200a Kline, Agan, and Tully were aware that Williams was following them and knew that secrecy was gone; Agan and Tully returned to Philadelphia because of the risk of violence. Kline had been delayed from the Penningtonville meeting and eventually tracked down the Gorsuch party on the morning of September 10 in Sadsbury. The party entering Christiana were Henry Kline, Edward Gorsuch, his son Dickinson Gorsuch, his nephew Joshua M. Gorsuch, his nephew Dr. Thomas Pierce, Nicholas T. Hutchings, and Nathan Nelson.Shortly after midnight on September 11, the Gorsuch party set out on the raid with a hired, disguised white guide. The first house he took them to supposedly had one of the slaves, but they decided to go to another place where two were staying, before returning for the first. Gorsuch believed that if he had captured two of the slaves, the third, whose wife he still held enslaved, could be persuaded to return. Just before dawn, the group reached William Parker's house, where the guide had said two slaves were staying. The guide left. It is unknown whether the guide had deliberately led them to the center of resistance in Lancaster County.:\u200a54\u201355\u200aWilliam Parker knew the group was hunting slaves. Also in his house were his wife, Eliza; her sister, Hannah; Hannah's husband, Alexander Pinckney; and Abraham Johnson. Two visitors were also there: Joshua Kite, also known as John Beard, who was one of Gorsuch's escaped slaves, probably Nelson Ford; and Samuel Thompson, another of the escaped slaves who had taken a new name. Sarah Pownall, a white neighbor and wife of Parker's landlord, stopped by the evening of September 10 to warn that if the raiders came, all of the blacks should flee to Canada.:\u200a57\u201358\u200aAs the raiders traveled up to Parker's house, which was on a hill, they ran into Joshua Kite, possibly returning home or possibly acting as a lookout, and Gorsuch recognized him as one of the escaped slaves. Kite recognized his former owner and rushed back to the house, yelling a warning. Accounts of events over the next two hours are contradictory.:\u200a58\u201359\u200a Parker and his household moved to the second floor with their guns and were in a good position to defend themselves.The Kline and Gorsuch party surrounded the house, and the US Marshal announced their legal authority to seize Nelson Ford. Parker and his household refused to give up Ford, with some debate. Eliza Parker blew the horn to signal to local Blacks that help was needed. Shots were fired, either first by the posse at Eliza Parker, or first by the household at Gorsuch when he attempted to enter the house; no one was seriously injured at this time.:\u200a62\u200a Dickinson, Gorsuch, and Kline recommended retreat to recruit a larger force; Edward Gorsuch refused. The household asked for time. They discussed whether the two refugee slaves should surrender.:\u200a58\u201362\u200aParker may have been delaying so reinforcements could arrive. Numerous armed men arrived, including Noah Buley, another of Gorsuch's escaped slaves. Also arriving were several neighboring whites, including Elijah Lewis, a local shopkeeper on foot, and Castner Hanway, a local miller on horseback. Gorsuch assumed that the white men, though unarmed, were leaders of the estimated 75 to 150 Blacks, many with guns, who arrived over the next 30 minutes. Kline believed that the white men would join his party in carrying out the law. He identified himself as a US Marshal and talked with them; Hanway refused to help him to arrest anyone. Hanway apparently told Kline and his group to leave before blood was shed. According to Lewis, Hanway begged the Blacks not to shoot.Kline apparently warned Hanway and Lewis they were committing a federal crime by not assisting him. When Edward Gorsuch confronted his slave Samuel Thompson, the man clubbed him. Gorsuch fell and was fatally shot multiple times. His son Dickinson went to his aid, and was also shot multiple times. He was able to move away and was aided by a white man: either Joseph Scarlett (according to Dickinson), or Levi Pownall (according to Parker). Dickinson was taken to the nearby Pownall house where, though initially expected to die, he survived. Lewis left as soon as the violence started, as did Kline, who joined up with Nicholas Hutchins and followed Lewis.Joshua Gorsuch and Thomas Pearce fled when they realized that Edward Gorsuch was being attacked. They were sheltered by Hanway on his horse, but he was also trying to flee. He left at a gallop. Joshua Gorsuch and Thomas Pearce continued to flee; they were shot but escaped (or were let go).:\u200a62\u201373\u200a\n\n\n== Immediate aftermath ==\nParker, Gorsuch's former slaves, and some other blacks fled north to the eventual safety of Canada.:\u200a76\u200a In Rochester, New York, where he was to take a boat to Canada, Parker took refuge in the house of Frederick Douglass. He had known him when both were slaves in Maryland. Douglass arranged for the group to catch the ferry to Canada.:\u200a78\u200a The Christiana Riot had been the latest in a series of confrontations over fugitive slaves, following on the heels of several high-profile cases in Boston including the escape of Shadrach Minkins from custody in February 1851. The Federal government had been stymied in its efforts to enforce those cases, and was becoming harsher to create a deterrent. In the case of the re-enslavement of Thomas Sims in April, federal marshals and army soldiers had been used to keep order. However, these previous incidents had been without white deaths. The death of the slave owner in the Christiana riot led to President Fillmore to call out the marines. They searched the area and eventually arrested 36 blacks and five whites. The federal government, wishing to set an example, charged them with the severe offense of treason. Fillmore's actions were somewhat pragmatic: the issue aroused strong sentiments in the South, and Southerners called for the rioters to be hanged or else the South might secede. It received national press coverage. Northerners were also agitated, as \u2013 according to them \u2013 it demonstrated the reach of the Slave Power and especially the Fugitive Slave Act into the otherwise free North.:\u200a84\u201385\u200a\n\n\n== Legal proceedings ==\nOn October 6, 1851, indictments for the first 38 people listed below were remitted from the District Court to the Circuit Court.:\u200a58\u201359\u200a On November 14, 1851, the Grand Jury of the United States District Court, Philadelphia returned true bills of indictment against 41 people.:\u200a2\u200a Parker and some others were charged in absentia.The 41 men charged (ordered as on the indictment), except where noted, were Black::\u200a84,\u200a96,\u200a199,\u200a210\u200a :\u200a76\u200a :\u200a2\u200a :\u200a153\u200a\n\n\n=== United States vs. Castner Hanway ===\n\nCastner Hanway (sometimes spelled Hanaway), one of the five white men charged and alleged to be a ringleader, was the first to be tried. His trial at the US Courthouse in Philadelphia lasted from November 24 until December 11, 1851. Supreme Court Justice Robert C. Grier and U.S. District Court Judge John K. Kane presided. The prosecution was headed by John W. Ashmead of the US Attorney's office, who was joined by lawyers from Maryland. Thaddeus Stevens headed the defense team.:\u200a116\u200a Theodore Cuyler made the opening speech for the defense.:\u200a127\u200aHanway was acquitted by the jury after 15 minutes of deliberation. The prosecutor then withdrew the other charges, as it was apparent that the charge of treason could hardly be satisfied. The defense pointed out the absurdity of trying a group of poorly armed Quaker farmers for somehow levying war against the United States.\n\n\n== Fate of those involved ==\nWilliam Parker was joined in Canada by Eliza, his wife, in November 1851, and eventually their children. They settled in Buxton, Ontario. He died sometime before 1881, and Eliza died in May 1899. Some of their descendants still live in Canada.Castner Hanway moved in 1878 to Wilber, Nebraska, and died there in 1893.Edward Gorsuch's youngest son, Thomas Gorsuch, and his schoolmate John Wilkes Booth swore revenge for Edward's death.\n\n\n== Historical markers ==\nIn September 1911 a dedication ceremony for a memorial to the incident in Christiana took place with descendants of both sides present and also of Peter Woods, one of those indicted.

"Permissible_exposure_limit| Chemical safety| Concentration indicators| Environmental standards| National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health| Occupational Safety and Health Administration| ","The permissible exposure limit (PEL or OSHA PEL) is a legal limit in the United States for exposure of an employee to a chemical substance or physical agent such as high level noise. Permissible exposure limits are established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  Most of OSHA's PELs were issued shortly after adoption of the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act in 1970.For chemicals, the chemical regulation is usually expressed in parts per million (ppm), or sometimes in milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3). Units of measure for physical agents such as noise are specific to the agent.\nA PEL is usually given as a time-weighted average (TWA), although some are short-term exposure limits (STEL) or ceiling limits. A TWA is the average exposure over a specified period, usually a nominal eight hours. This means that, for limited periods, a worker may be exposed to concentration excursions higher than the PEL, so long as the TWA is not exceeded and any applicable excursion limit is not exceeded. An excursion limit typically means that \"

The system consists of two nearly identical red dwarf stars located in the constellation Draco. The two stars orbit each other with a period of 1.27 days with a separation of 2.7 million kilometres (0.018 AU). Along with two stars in the triple system KOI 126, the stars in CM Draconis are the lightest stars with precisely measured masses and radii. Consequently, the system plays an important role in testing stellar structure models for very low mass stars. These comparisons find that models underpredict the stellar radii by approximately 5%. This is attributed to consequences of the stars' strong magnetic activity.\nAccording to the system's entry in the Combined General Catalogue of Variable Stars, at least one of the components is a flare star and at least one is a BY Draconis variable. The white dwarf star GJ 630.1B, located 25.7 arcseconds away shares the same proper motion as the CM Draconis stars and is thus a true companion star of the system. Given the system's distance of 47 light years, this corresponds to a separation of at least 370 astronomical units between CM Draconis and GJ 630.1B.\n\n\n== Possible planetary system ==\nThe system was the subject of a dedicated search for transiting extrasolar planets in orbit around the binary from 1994\u20131999. In the end, the existence of all of the transiting planet candidates suggested by the project was ruled out.Based on variations in the timing of the system's eclipses, it has been suggested that there may be an object in a circumbinary orbit around the two red dwarf stars. In 2000, it was proposed that a Jovian planet is orbiting the system with a period of 750\u20131050 days. A later analysis of timing variations did not confirm this proposed planet and instead suggested that there was a Jovian planet in an 18.5-year orbit, or a more massive object further out. This analysis was itself not supported by a 2009 study that found the eclipse timings were indistinguishable from linear, though the binary stars do have a small eccentricity that may indicate that they are being perturbed by an orbiting body that prevents the orbit from being fully circularised by tidal effects. A massive planet or brown dwarf on an orbit of 50\u2013200 days would fulfil the observational criteria: the requirement for dynamical stability, the constraints from the lack of observed timing variations and the requirement that the object can maintain the eccentricity of the binary stars.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"

"Com.x| Comic book publishing companies of the United Kingdom| Publishing companies established in 2000| 2000 establishments in the United Kingdom| ","Com.x is a British comic publishing company.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2000\u20132002 ===\nCom.x was founded in 2000 by Eddie Deighton, Russell Uttley and Neil Googe. Deighton later described how the group came together in 1999:\n\nNeil originally came for an interview as a designer at the design agency Russell and myself ran, but as soon as we saw in his portfolio that Neil had trained as a comic artist and had worked on 2000AD, we ended up talking for about 4 hours about comics and the industry in general. By the time we finished, we felt that Neil's talent would have gone to waste if we'd taken him on as a designer, so we decided instead to propose to our client, Konami, that we should work with Neil on a graphic novel for the computer game Silent Hill. They felt it would be a cool thing to do, so Neil came on board and we began developing the project. Very quickly, we found that we all got on really well and by about the third week of working together, we felt we had a lot to contribute to the comic industry in terms of enthusiasm and creativity.\nThe company published a number of titles in the following couple of years like Cla$$war by Rob Williams and Trevor Hairsine, Puncture by Uttley and Ben Oliver, Razorjack by John Higgins and Bazooka Jules by Googe.Rob Williams suggested that the relatively greater impact Com.x had on the American publishing companies was:\n\nIt was purely the American format and the attention we received from the U.S. comic press. I just think Com.X's books talked to the American publishers in their own language\u2014they looked and read like U.S. books so, hey, it\u2019s not that big a leap for American editors to see us working in American books.\nThe downside of this for the company was that their artists, like Trevor Hairsine, Ben Oliver, Joshua Middleton and Neil Googe, were snapped up by Marvel and DC.They ran into bigger problems in 2002 when their offices were burgled and it took them time to recover. Other named projects, like Battle Raven Six by Antony Johnston, were never published and the company went quiet for over a year.\n\n\n=== 2003\u20132004 ===\nThe second phase of the company's activity took place in 2003 and 2004. The first three issues of Cla$$war were collected into a trade paperback in 2003 and the series was finished in 2004 with new artist Travel Foreman. However, when interviewed in 2004 Googe said he did not feel the company had fully returned:\n\nWe have had a few bits out this year, Cla$$war was finished, as was Puncture and we had the Last American graphic novel ... but as a fully functioning publisher ... well no, the simple fact is we underestimated what it would take... and enthusiasm only gets you so far. We never really had that much cash and so when the big guns came knocking for the likes of Trev and Josh, with their promise of great projects, we just couldn't compete. ...\nSo Com.X will continue to chase the deals it's already looking at, as for the comics, I like to think of it as lying dormant until such a time as it can return properly.\nOther titles that were announced as returning, but never appeared, include Bazooka Jules with new artist LeSean Thomas and Thomas' own Cannon Busters.\n\n\n=== 2008\u2013present ===\nThe company returned fully to comics publishing in 2008, led by Eddie Deighton and business partner Benjamin Shahrabani, with a more sustainable business model. To avoid delays in the releasing of series, Deighton said that \"

Doane earned his teaching certificate in 1961 from the Nova Scotia Teachers College (NSTC) and then a bachelor of music education from [Boston University] in 1967 studying the trombone. While serving as supervisor of music for the Halifax Regional School Board from 1967 to 1984, Doane changed the school music program when he began using the ukulele as a practical and economical method of teaching instruments and music for both children and adults. This unconventional approach was quickly proven through the success of Halifax school bands and orchestras in concerts and competitions across Canada.Doane created the Guide to Classroom Ukulele in 1971.  The British Columbia schools used Doane's system to teach music and as a result, the Langley Ukulele Ensemble came into existence. He improved on the system and created the Teacher's Guide to Classroom Ukulele in 1977.\nAfter leaving the Halifax School Board in 1984, Doane served as a professor of music education at his alma mater, the Nova Scotia Teachers College until his retirement in 1993.The best known student to come out of Doane's program is James Hill, who plays the ukulele throughout the world and worked with Doane to revise the ukulele teaching system. Doane and Hill collaborated to create the Ukulele in the Classroom program in 2008.Doane was awarded an honorary doctor of fine arts from St. Mary's University in 2003.His daughter Melanie Doane is a noted Canadian pop singer and songwriter.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since June 12, 2017.The first settlers arrived in what is now Gaines Basin well before the Erie Canal (or any namesake turning basin thereon) did. Lansing Bailey and his brother Joel built a wooden cabin there in 1812. By 1823, as the Erie Canal was nearing completion, the family had moved on, and the building was being used as a school house.It was not long before a burgeoning population\u2014brought on by the Canal and expanding settlement of Orleans County (which split from Genesee County in 1824)\u2014necessitated a larger structure for educating local children. The new school was built in 1832 of local cobblestone, as was common in the area, on land across the road from the old school building. The new building had 913 square feet of space and continued serving as a school until 1944, when centralization caused Gaines District No. 2 to be consolidated into the Albion Central School District.The building sat unused for decades until efforts to preserve the deteriorating building began in 2014. In 2015, a historical marker was added, and by 2017 restoration efforts had progressed enough to have the property listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Also that year, a donated outhouse was moved to the property. By 2021, the interior had been restored to its 1940s appearance, with the original teacher's desk and authentic decor.Having received the property as a donation, the Orleans County Historical Association (which spearheaded the restoration work) intends to use the building for history programs and gatherings.\n\n\n== References =="

After a long career as a ballet dancer and company director, he is now widely considered to be one of the foremost European choreographers of his time.\n\n\n== Early life and training ==\nBorn in Basel into a prosperous family, Heinz Sp\u00f6rli was exposed to theater arts at an early age, thanks to the enthusiasm of his father. As a schoolboy, he appeared as an extra in a number of local productions and sometimes took small acting or dancing roles. At age 17, he began taking ballet classes with Walter Kleiber, a well-known local teacher, while continuing his formal education. Upon graduation from school, he completed his compulsory military service in the Swiss Army before resuming his dance training. Realizing his natural talent for ballet and hoping to make it his career, he devoted himself to his ballet classes and to his studies in dance, music, and art history. During this time, he changed the spelling of his surname from Sp\u00f6rli to Spoerli.\n\n\n== Career ==\nDespite his late start, Spoerli advanced rapidly in his dance training, and in 1960, at age 19, he was engaged as an artist of the Basel Municipal \nTheater, directed by Vaslav Orlikovsky. He continued to improve his classical technique while appearing in operas, operettas, and the spectacular ballet productions that Orlikovsky mounted. In 1963 Spoerli joined the Cologne State Opera Ballet, directed by Todd Bolender. There he was exposed to an international repertory of high caliber, including works of Balanchine, B\u00e9jart, Cranko, de Mille, and Lander. In 1966 he moved to Canada, having been hired as a soloist by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, directed by Arnold Spohr. The following year, 1967, he made his first choreographies, two short pas de deux for the Calgary Ballet Company. After a brief stint back in Cologne, he returned to Canada in late 1967 as a soloist with Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in Montreal. There, under the direction of Ludmilla Chiriaeff and Fernand Nault, he danced in both classical and modern works by Dolin, Lichine, Nault, Paige, Kuch, and Butler. In 1969 Spoerli returned to Switzerland, where he danced as a soloist with the Basel Ballet, directed by Pavel Smok, and then with the Ballet du Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Gen\u00e8ve, directed by Alfonso Cat\u00e1. In Geneva from 1970 to 1973 he again danced in works by Balanchine and other prominent neoclassical choreographers. There, in 1972, he also made his first major ballet, Le Chemin (\"

"Pitted_keratolysis| Bacterium-related cutaneous conditions| ","Pitted keratolysis (also known as Keratolysis plantare sulcatum, Keratoma plantare sulcatum, and Ringed keratolysis) is a bacterial skin infection of the foot. The infection is characterized by craterlike pits on the sole of the feet and toes, particularly weight bearing areas.\nThe infection is caused by Corynebacterium species bacteria and Kytococcus sedentarius. Excessive sweating of the feet and use of occlusive footwear provide an environment in which these bacteria thrive and therefore increase the risk of developing pitted keratolysis.The condition is fairly common, especially in the military where wet shoes/boots are worn for extended periods of time without removing/cleaning. Skin biopsy specimens are not usually utilized, as the diagnosis of pitted keratolysis is often made by visual examination and recognition of the characteristic odor. Wood's lamp examination results are inconsistent. Treatment of pitted keratolysis requires the application of antibiotics to the skin such as benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, or mupirocin. Prevention efforts aim to keep the feet dry by using moisture-wicking shoes and socks as well as antiperspirants.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nPitted keratolysis typically presents with white discoloration of the skin and numerous discrete, \"

"Bacillus_thuringiensis| Bacillus| Biopesticides| Genetically modified organisms in agriculture| Bacteria described in 1915| ","Bacillus thuringiensis (or Bt) is a Gram-positive, soil-dwelling bacterium, the most commonly used biological pesticide worldwide. B. thuringiensis also occurs naturally in the gut of caterpillars of various types of moths and butterflies, as well on leaf surfaces, aquatic environments, animal feces, insect-rich environments, and flour mills and grain-storage facilities. It has also been observed to parasitize other moths such as Cadra calidella\u2014in laboratory experiments working with C. calidella, many of the moths were diseased due to this parasite.During sporulation, many Bt strains produce crystal proteins (proteinaceous inclusions), called delta endotoxins, that have insecticidal action. This has led to their use as insecticides, and more recently to genetically modified crops using Bt genes, such as Bt corn. Many crystal-producing Bt strains, though, do not have insecticidal properties. The subspecies israelensis is commonly used for control of mosquitoes and of fungus gnats.As a toxic mechanism, cry proteins bind to specific receptors on the membranes of mid-gut (epithelial) cells of the targeted pests, resulting in their rupture. Other organisms (including humans, other animals and non-targeted insects) that lack the appropriate receptors in their gut cannot be affected by the cry protein, and therefore are not affected by Bt.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and discovery ==\nIn 1902, B. thuringiensis was first discovered in silkworms by Japanese sericultural engineer Ishiwatari Shigetane (\u77f3\u6e21 \u7e41\u80e4). He named it B. sotto, using the Japanese word sott\u014d (\u5352\u5012, 'collapse'), here referring to bacillary paralysis. In 1911, German microbiologist Ernst Berliner rediscovered it when he isolated it as the cause of a disease called Schlaffsucht in flour moth caterpillars in Thuringia (hence the specific name thuringiensis, \"

It is also used as an endpaper in books.\nThe development of ingres paper for drawing is ascribed to the French Neoclassical artist Dominique Ingres (1780-1867), although modern ingres papers can differ from those actually used by Ingres. Ingres paper's pattern is a laid mesh. The laid effect creates a toothy grain of close lines on one side and a mottled surface on the reverse. The toothiness allows the paper to take charcoal easily and evenly. Ingres paper is favored in book arts for its antique appearance and pH neutrality.\nProminent manufactures include Canson, Hahnem\u00fchle (sometimes called \"

"Tatanua_mask| Collections of Derby Museum and Art Gallery| Ritual masks| Masks in Papua New Guinea| ","A tatanua is a type of traditional mask made by the natives in the province of New Ireland, Papua New Guinea. The masks are made of wood and other natural materials and used in funeral ceremonies called malagan.\n\n\n== Manufacture ==\nTatanua face masks are normally carved from lime wood and completed and decorated with fibres from sugar cane, wool and other animal hair. The face is coloured using chalk and other natural dyes. The type with a high headdress are created using a cane framework that was formerly then covered in bark, although later imported fabric was used as the covering. Besides the fabric, some masks also included imported optical brighteners, which made some nominally white areas slightly blue.The masks are frequently identifiable by the pierced ear lobes and prominent mouth, which is normally carved as if the mouth is open. The masks can also be identified by the asymmetrical hair design: the mask is left bare of hair on one side to mimic how a New Ireland man would shave his head to show that he was in mourning.\n\n\n== Ceremony ==\nTatanua masks are worn by ceremonial dancers and are often a part of New Ireland Malagan rituals. These are funerary religious ceremonies held by the family of the deceased to communicate with deities and to show respect for the deceased. Mannequins or statues representing the soul of the deceased are also shown at the malagan ceremonies. The local people construct them so that they celebrate the dead person's characteristics. They are elaborated with anthropomorphic symbols which are thought to represent the link between the people of New Ireland, their creation and the spiritual world to which they eventually pass on. The dances were performed in groups; only those who were respected would be allowed the honour of performing the dance, as it was important that observers see the community's strength.The carved masks may take many months to construct, so that the person's death may not be formally marked for some time. The celebrations would be used as a time for the community to illustrate its skills to its neighbours as well as to meet, agree and perform the cultural aspect of a community member dying.\n\n\n== Examples ==\nExamples of this style of mask can be seen in the Ethnological Museum of Berlin, Derby Museum and Art Gallery, the British Museum and the Indianapolis Museum of Art.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nEharo mask\nTopeng\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMalanggan: Art, Memory and Sacrifice, Susanne K\u00fcchler, Berg Publishers\nTatanua Masks from New Ireland, RandAfricanArt.com"

Sherman (born October 25, 1949) is an American experimental criminologist and police educator who is the founder of evidence-based policing.\nSherman's use of randomized controlled experiments to study deterrence and crime prevention has led him to examine such wide-ranging issues as domestic violence, saturation patrol, gun violence, crack houses, and reintegrative shaming. He has collaborated with over 30 police and justice agencies around the world, and been credited as a key founder of the field of experimental criminology.\nSherman holds the posts of Director of the Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology and Wolfson Professor of Criminology Emeritus at the University of Cambridge, where he is also Chair of the Cambridge Police Executive Program. He is also  the Director of the Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing, and Editor-in-Chief of the Centre's Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSherman graduated magna cum laude from Denison University in 1970, with a B.A. in Political Science. He received an M.A. in social science from the University of Chicago in 1970, earned a Diploma in Criminology from Cambridge University in 1973, and received his M.A. and Ph.D.in sociology from Yale University in 1974 and 1976 respectively.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nSherman's career began at age 20 in the New York City Mayor's Office and Police Department as an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation New York City Urban Fellow and aide to the NYPD's Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy, where he began a long research partnership with NYPD Assistant Chief Tony Bouza. Bouza became the Minneapolis Police Chief in 1980, where he persuaded the City Council to approve Sherman's research design to randomly assign arrest for misdemeanor domestic violence, later known as the Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment. Sherman's early experimental research into the influence of arrest on recidivism in spouse abuse led to changes in police department policies and procedures nationwide, encouraged state legislatures to modify state statutes to allow for misdemeanor arrest, and eventually resulted in five federally funded replications, one of which Sherman led in Milwaukee. In the late 1980s, Sherman's discovery of hot spots of crime  led to his experimental research with David Weisburd and Tony Bouza that was first to show clear crime prevention effects of directed police patrol in high crime locations. In the early 1990s, Sherman's Kansas City Gun Experiment studied the effect of concentrated police patrol on gun crime and violence and that directed police patrol in gun crime \"

It is considered to be one of the biggest rivalries in Gaelic games. Mayo's home ground is MacHale Park in Castlebar, while Galway play their home games in Salthill's Pearse Stadium or St Jarlath's Park in Tuam.\nThe Tribesmen have enjoyed greater success in the All-Ireland, having won nine titles to Mayo's three. The rivalry has historically been good-natured but has taken on a harder edge since the turn of the millennium, with the mood between supporters souring.\n\n\n== History ==\nOne of the oldest rivalries in Gaelic football, the fixture was first contested in the 1901 Championship with Mayo winning by 2-4 to 0-3 on the day. The game, which took place in Claremorris on 9 November 1902, was the first official final of the Connacht Championship. The Connacht GAA Council was founded on the same day.Mayo were the first of the two to contest an All-Ireland final, when they faced Wexford in the 1916 final. Galway became the first to win the tournament in the 1925 Championship (though the Championship itself was not completed until 1926). The 1930s was the greatest era of dominance for the two teams; between 1932 and 1942 Galway and Mayo contested eight All-Ireland senior finals, with Galway winning titles in 1934 and 1938, and Mayo winning their maiden title in 1936. The teams were also two of the strongest teams in the country in the 1950s and 1960s, with Mayo winning in 1950 and 1951, and Galway winning in 1956, 1964, 1965 and 1966. In that era, each team regularly gave the other their toughest game of the year. Following Galway's 1966 triumph however, no Connacht team would win an All-Ireland for another 32 years.The rivalry has historically been characterised as relatively friendly, with many Galway and Mayo players from the 1950s\u201360s teams having attended the same schools and players from the border areas having family ties in the other county. This is in contrast to the more bitter rivalries in the sport like Cork\u2013Kerry or Armagh\u2013Tyrone. The good-natured rivalry has also been attributed to the similarities between the two counties and the shared socio-economic challenges they have faced through the years. With a total of nearly 40,000 people emigrating from the two counties from 1951 to 1966, their shared success in football was considered one of the few bright spots in that era.The friendliness of the contest has been tested in recent years however. Following defeats for Mayo in the 1996 and 1997 All-Ireland finals, Galway knocked Mayo out in the opening round of the 1998 Championship and went on to win the title. Galway, who were managed by Mayo-man John O'Mahony, also won the title in 2001. Galway's win, on the back of Mayo's two defeats and under the stewardship of a Mayo native, left a sour taste.

He specialized in number theory and analysis, and proved several results that eluded even Gauss. Like Galois and Abel before him, Eisenstein died before the age of 30. He was born and died in Berlin, Prussia.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHis parents, Johann Konstantin Eisenstein and Helene Pollack, were of Jewish descent and converted to Protestantism prior to his birth. From an early age, he demonstrated talent in mathematics and music. As a young child he learned to play piano, and he continued to play and compose for piano throughout his life.\nHe suffered various health problems throughout his life, including meningitis as an infant, a disease that took the lives of all five of his brothers and sisters. In 1837, at the age of 14, he enrolled at Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium, and soon thereafter at Friedrich Werder Gymnasium in Berlin. His teachers recognized his talents in mathematics, but by 15 years of age he had already learned all the material taught at the school. He then began to study differential calculus from the works of Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange.\nAt 17, still a student, Eisenstein began to attend classes given by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and others at the University of Berlin. In 1842, before taking his final exams, he traveled with his mother to England, to search for his father. In 1843 he met William Rowan Hamilton in Dublin, who gave him a copy of his book on Niels Henrik Abel's proof of the impossibility of solving fifth-degree polynomials, a work that would stimulate Eisenstein's interest in mathematical research.\n\n\n== Five remarkable years ==\nIn 1843 Eisenstein returned to Berlin, where he passed his graduation exams and enrolled in the University the following autumn. In January 1844 he had already presented his first work to the Berlin Academy, on cubic forms in two variables. The same year he met for the first time with Alexander von Humboldt, who would later become Eisenstein's patron. Humboldt managed to find grants from the King, the government of Prussia, and the Berlin academy to compensate for Eisenstein's extreme poverty. The money, always late and grudgingly given, was earned in full measure by Eisenstein: in 1844 alone he published over 23 papers and two problems in Crelle's Journal, including two proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity, and the analogous laws of cubic reciprocity and quartic reciprocity.\nIn June 1844 Eisenstein visited Carl Friedrich Gauss in G\u00f6ttingen. In 1845, Kummer saw to it that he received an honorary doctorate at the University of Breslau. Jacobi also encouraged the distinction, but later relations between Jacobi and Eisenstein were always rocky, due primarily to a disagreement over the order of discoveries made in 1846. In 1847 Eisenstein habilitated at the University of Berlin, and he began to teach there. Bernhard Riemann attended his classes on elliptic functions.\n\n\n== Imprisonment and death ==\nIn 1848 Eisenstein was imprisoned briefly by the Prussian army for his revolutionary activities in Berlin. Eisenstein always had republican sympathies, and while he did not actively participate in the revolution of 1848, he was arrested on 19 March of that year. Although he was released just one day later, the harsh treatment he suffered damaged his already delicate health. But his association with the Republican cause led to his official stipends being revoked, despite Humboldt tenaciously coming to his defense.\nDespite his health, Eisenstein continued writing papers on quadratic partitions of prime numbers and the reciprocity laws. In 1851, at the instigation of Gauss, he was elected to the Academy of G\u00f6ttingen; one year later, this time at the recommendation of Dirichlet, he was also elected to the Academy of Berlin.\nHe died of tuberculosis at the age of 29. Humboldt, then 83, accompanied his remains to the cemetery. He had recently obtained, too late, as it turned out, the funding necessary to send Eisenstein on holiday to Sicily.\n\n\n== Purported Gauss quote ==\n\nE. T. Bell in his 1937 book Men of Mathematics (page 237) claims that Gauss said \"

The painting depicts three nighttime city scenes from the Weimar Republic.  The painting belongs to the Kunstmuseum Stuttgart since it was bought from the artist's estate in 1972.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe main topic of the tryptych is the different aspects of the nightlife in a German big city of the golden twenties. The interior of a dance bar is shown on the middle panel. A band dominated by brass is playing on the left. The rich and beautiful sit and stand on the right. The women present visible jewelry and wear dresses, the fabrics and patterns of which could also be found in medieval paintings. The two groups are joined by a couple dancing Shimmy. Their bodies are reflected in the polished parquet. The background of the room is kept dark red. On the left panel, several prostitutes stand contemptuously in front of the bar's red-lit entrance, looking at two men, one lying on the floor and the other a war cripple. The men are barked at by a dog. On the very outside you can see an almost hidden woman looking out of a gate. The right panel shows a group of high-class prostitutes dressed in furs, who seem to be striving towards the viewer in a row and carelessly walking past another war cripple. The fur collar and the red dress of the foremost reproduce the appearance of a vulva. The right panel ends in a wild architecture that does not seem to be correct.\nThe themes of the painting are femininity, decadence and sexuality in the modern city.

"Periyanayagi_Madha_Shrine,_Avur| Churches in Pudukkottai district| Roman Catholic churches in Tamil Nadu| 1547 establishments in India| ","Periyanayagi Madha Shrine is a Roman Catholic church in the village of Avur, 28 kilometres (17 mi) from the town of Pudukkottai in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It was constructed by Rev. John Venatius Bachet in 1547. The church was rebuilt in 1747. The renowned Italian missionary and Tamil scholar Joseph Beschi served in this church.\n\n\n== History of Avur ==\nThe Sangam poet Avur Kizhar was born in Avur, at that time it was a village with the Pudukkottai - Tiruchirappalli border.\nApparently, the village is called 'a + oor' ('cow village') because of the large numbers of wild bulls and cows that used to graze in an oorani (drinking water tank) on the outskirts of a jungle here.\n\n\n== Church & Missionary Activities ==\nEarly in the 17th century, the Madurai Mission extended its jurisdiction to Tiruchirappalli from Avur, which was sparsely populated in the 15th and 16th centuries.Later Father Emmanuel Martins chose Avur as a site for his Mission. It was granted by the Perambur Kattalur Palayakarars in 1686. Initially the place was under the jurisdiction of the Kolattur Tondaimans, and then later by the  Tondaimans as well.\nThis monument is made up of eight columns raised 56 feet above the ground, and shaped like a cross, measuring 240 feet in length, 38 feet in width, and 28 feet in height.\nFather Venantius Bouchet, the first missionary at Avur, who joined the Madurai Mission in 1688, aimed to make Avur a Christian centre of considerable importance. The chapel was a special area of inspiration for him. With the contributions from well-wishers and Tondaiman, an impressive chapel much stronger than simply mud walls and thatched roofs had been completed in 1697.\nRaghunatha Raya Tondaiman met Bishop of Santhome on his first pastoral trip to Madurai Mission and Avur in 1711, when he visited Avur as the founder of Pudukkottai Tondaimans. A non-Christian king responded with great courtesy to a visiting priest. This is a gesture of great significance for one who does not hold a Christian faith.\n\n\n== Poignant Incident ==\nThe church's fortunes changed drastically in 1716. The conflict between the Nayak rulers, who allied with Mughals and the Tondaimans caused the foundations of the church to be razed to the ground. The incident is described in the General History of Pudukkottai State. A few soldiers of the Tondaiman had managed to steal some bullocks from the Mughal army not far from Avur. The Mughal became furious, and the Missionary was asked to either return the bullocks or to surrender his life.\nRev. Fr. Beschi, the missionary in temporary charge of Avur at the time, had to answer the charge. As he could not get the bullocks back, he quietly accepted the soldiers' alternative proposal. As the infuriated soldiers were unable to hurt their prisoner, they chained him up and led him to their camp amidst insults and threats. When they found that the prisoner bore the treatment with unflinching tranquility, they became so exasperated that they stripped him naked exposed him to the midday sun.\nHowever, as soon as the chief, Chanda Sahib, learned of this, he immediately ordered the prisoner's release. In a tender embrace, the chief asked the missionary to sit at his side; when the missionary protested, the chief explained that his actions had been done without his knowledge. The men, who had insulted the missionary a short time earlier, were moved by the honour shown to him. Indeed, the danger he had incurred led to his safety and to that of the village.\n\n\n== Festival ==\nA Passion play takes place during the Easter season, followed by a car festival in the summer, which attracts people of all faiths.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nTourist Guide to Tamil Nadu.

It is officially headed by Amii Omara-Otunnu.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe government of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, which has been in power since 1986, formerly banned other political parties, but in a 2005 referendum, opposition parties were re-legalised.In May 2013, David Sejusa, who had held important positions in the national government and a former fighter in the rebellion that brought Museveni to power after the ouster of Milton Obote, parted ways with Uganda's establishment and left the country for England. Sejusa made allegations that Museveni's son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, was being prepared to eventually simply replace his father as president, in effect establishing a monarchy. Kainerugaba denied the allegations, while his father made no public statements about his future plans.In November 2013, while living in exile in England, Sejusa was removed from his seat as a member of Uganda's parliament due to his prolonged absence. That same month, Sejusa and others announced the formation of the Freedom and Unity Front as a new political party in Uganda.

"Rosenberg_Castle_(Obwalden)| Castles in Obwalden| ","Rosenberg Castle is a ruined castle in the municipality of Giswil in the canton of Obwalden in Switzerland.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nRosenberg Castle is the westernmost of three ruined castles in Giswil.  Traditionally thought to be part of a defensive line due to their proximity and that they lay in a straight line, they are now generally believed to be three separate castles built for different purposes.  The easternmost, Rudenz Castle was built by the Knights of Rudenz in the early 13th century.  It lies about 2 km (1.2 mi) from Rosenberg.  The center castle, Hunwil Castle was completely demolished to provide stone for the parish church which was dedicated in 1635.The village of Giswil was a fief of Murbach-Lucerne Abbey in the 9th century.  An ecclesiastical bailiff administered the Abbey's lands and had a residence somewhere in the village.  By the 12th century the bailiff had a stone building on the castle site.  It was demolished and replaced with a tower house in the 13th century.  The tower was probably surrounded by a ring wall and ditch, though no traces remain.\nIn 1291 the Habsburgs bought the town of Lucerne and the Unterwalden estates, including Giswil, from Murbach Abbey.  The Habsburgs appointed one of their vassals as the bailiff, probably making it a hereditary office.  The last member of this vassal family is mentioned in 1347 as Mathis the Meier von Giswil.  After his death, the office passed to the Rudenz family, who already owned a castle and estates in Giswil.  A few years later, in 1361, the Rudenz family had to give Rosenberg to Landammann of Obwalden George von Hunwil, who began building Hunwil Castle.  In 1382, George von Hunwil was forced to leave Obwalden for Lucerne.  In 1387 Jenni von Wennishusen was the bailiff over the village, living in either Rosenberg or Hunwil Castles.  Around 1400 the parish of Giswil bought the former ecclesiastical lands and Rosenberg Castle lost its importance as the center of those lands.The castle was mentioned as destroyed in a record from 1532.  In 1664-67 the chapel of St. Anthony of Padua was built near the ruins.  During the 17th century, the name Rosenberg started to be used for the castle ruins.  By 1900 only an overgrown mound remained of the castle.  In 1935 the castle site was purchased by the Canton and in the following year it was excavated, cleaned and repaired.  A small archeological expedition in 1990 found a few artifacts and traces of the 12th century stone building.\n\n\n== Castle site ==\nThe castle is a square stone tower of about 9.3 m \u00d7 9.3 m (31 ft \u00d7 31 ft).  The walls are up to 2 m (6.6 ft) thick and are up to 3 m (9.8 ft) high.  The large window openings are visible at the top of the remaining walls.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of castles and fortresses in Switzerland\n\n\n== References =="
"Hordeum_brachyantherum| Hordeum| Bunchgrasses of North America| Bunchgrasses of Asia| ","Hordeum brachyantherum,  known by the common name meadow barley, is a species of barley. It is native to western North America from Alaska to northern Mexico, coastal areas of easternmost Russia (Kamchatka), and a small area of coastal Newfoundland.\nThe diploid cytotype occurs only in California, throughout the state, while everywhere else plants are tetraploid.\nThis is a tufting perennial bunchgrass approaching a meter in maximum height. It produces compact, narrow inflorescences 8 to 10 centimeters long and purplish in color. Like other barleys the spikelets come in triplets. It has two small, often sterile lateral spikelets on pedicels and a larger, fertile central spikelet lacking a pedicel.\n\n\n== General information ==\nHordeum brachyantherum belongs to grass family, Poaceae, genus Hordeum. There are two common cytotypes of Hordeum brachyantherum.  The diploid mainly grow in California, the tetraploid grow widely over the world. Polyploidy is very common in plants. Polyploidization plays an important role in plant evolution, it is commonly used in agriculture to develop novel phenotypes. Polyploidization also occurs naturally in plant populations. In 1980, a rare hexaploid form of Hordeum brachyantherum was discovered in California within the populations of diploid and tetraploid Hordeum brachyantherum. It was hypothesized that this hexaploid form was evolved by outcrossing between diploid Hordeum marine and tetraploid Hordeum brachyantherum ssp. brachyantherum and followed by duplication of chromosome. Polyploidization may lead to speciation because the reproductive isolation may develop between hexaploid and either tetraploid or diploid due to the mistake of alignment during meiosis.\n\n\n== Homology ==\nHordeum contains a gene called hordoindoline that involves grain hardness and antimicrobial activity. Since wheat contains a homologous gene named puroindoline, it was concluded that Hordeum and wheat shared a common ancestor during the evolutionary process. The novel variants of hordoindoline genes were found in Hordeum brachyantherum. It was hypothesized that the novel genes arose due to the gene duplication during the early stage of the divergence of the genus Hordeum. Some of the non-synonymous mutations are beneficial and show an overall improved antifungal activity. These non-synonymous mutations provide the material for evolution because natural selection can select for organisms who possess these mutations and alter the allele frequency over time.\n\n\n== Salinity ==\nNatural selection can also act on salinity tolerance for many plants. High salinity may negatively impact germination success, plant growth, and survival. Thus, under evolutionary process including natural selection, some plants developed morphological and physiological adaptations to live in high salinity conditions. The effect of salinity on germination rate shows both inter-specific and intra-specific variation. Compared to other perennial plants such as Agrostis stolonifera, Hordeum brachyantherum is more tolerated under high salinity. The seedling lengths and root or shoot lengths show different responses to high salinity. The seedling lengths of Hordeum brachyantherum are more negatively affected by high salinity. The intra-specific variation in the ability to tolerate elevated salinity among populations of Hordeum brachyantherum may result from the genetic variation which underlines the basis of evolution of Hordeum brachyantherum.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nOne major function of perennial plants is to restore the land and ecosystem. Hordeum brachyantherum is used to restore the native perennial grasslands in California and to reduce the density of non-native annual plants. The perennial plants can rapidly recover the soil microbial biomass in the grasslands due to the carbon supply maintained by the perennial plants. The species diversity and composition is not affected by the restoration, however, the relative proportion of the native plant biomass increased in the restored perennial grassland.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJepson Manual Treatment\nUSDA Plants Profile\nPhoto gallery"

As of 2019, it has not been named.\n\n\n== Orbit and classification ==\n\n1999 CW8 is an Apollo asteroid that crosses Earth's orbit. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.9\u20133.6 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,221 days; semi-major axis of 2.24 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.60 and an inclination of 34\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid never approaches Earth closer than 0.2 AU in the foreseeable future, but occasionally makes close approaches to Mars of 0.07 AU. It makes one such approach in 2073, at 0.067 AU, and another one in 2103, at 0.094 AU. Due to 1999 CW8's relatively high inclination, although it passes closer to the Sun than the Earth (0.9 AU), it never comes closer than 0.2 AU.\n\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\nIt is a carbonaceous B-type asteroid, relatively rare in the asteroid belt but common in the inner Solar System. Based on an absolute magnitude of 18.6, and an assumed albedo of 0.159 (derived from the B-type asteroid 2 Pallas), the asteroid can be estimated to have a mean-diameter of approximately 640 meters. If it impacted the Earth would cause significant damage, but not as much as the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event progenitor, which brought about a mass extinction, as it is only 1/20 to 1/10 the size. However, it is unlikely to come close enough to Earth to impact it, or even become a risk of impact.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMars-crossing asteroid\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(523972) 1999 CW8 at NeoDyS-2, Near Earth Objects\u2014Dynamic Site\nEphemeris \u00b7 Obs prediction \u00b7 Orbital info \u00b7 MOID \u00b7 Proper elements \u00b7 Obs info \u00b7 Close \u00b7 Physical info \u00b7 NEOCC\n(523972) 1999 CW8 at ESA\u2013space situational awareness\nEphemerides \u00b7 Observations \u00b7 Orbit \u00b7 Physical Properties \u00b7 Summary\n(523972) 1999 CW8 at the JPL Small-Body Database"

The force consists of 16,000 soldiers: 2500 officers and active-duty soldiers and 13,500 reservists. It includes an Army and an Air Corps.\nThe South Ossetian Army was formed in 1992, and is the primary defense force in the breakaway republic of South Ossetia, largely considered to be within internationally recognized Georgian territory.\nAccording to the 2017 agreement with Russia, parts of the South Ossetian forces were integrated with Russia's 4th Guards Military Base stationed in the territory, while the size of the entity's remaining military is to be agreed with the Russian authorities.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Ossetian Republican Guard (Russian: \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u044f \u041e\u0441\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0438) was organized on 15 November 1991 to participate in the defence of the national capital of Tskhinvali. Just a week later, Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia ordered over 10,000 soldiers to the republic. When it was created, it was mostly a loosely organized group of guerillas. It was a participant in the 1991\u20131992 South Ossetia War, providing 2,400 guardsmen to fight against forces from the National Guard of Georgia. On 17 November 1992, the Supreme Soviet of South Ossetia approved the formation the Ministry of Defence to lead the military. The first combat units of the national armed forces were formed in February 1993. The first units in the MoD was the Military Intelligence Unit and the Artillery Division.\n\n\n=== 2008 South Ossetia War ===\nThe South Ossetian military fought against the Georgian forces in the 2008 South Ossetia War. At the time of the major Georgian offensive, the bulk of the Ossetian force was concentrated in the settlement of Java to the north of Tskhinvali. According to Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, what thwarted the Georgian operation in the end was the resistance offered by peacekeepers and lightly armed South Ossetian units that stayed behind to defend the capital. Also Russian regular army forces entered the fighting on August 8 and drove deep into Georgia proper, occasionally accompanied or followed by South Ossetian militia who committed serious human rights violations, particularly in the Georgian villages of South Ossetia.According one estimate, the losses of the South Ossetian military forces, militia, and volunteers in the war amounted to 150 dead.

"CBS_Studios| CBS Studios| Television production companies of the United States| Paramount Global subsidiaries| Companies based in Los Angeles| 2006 establishments in California| American companies established in 2006| Mass media companies established in 2006| ","CBS Studios is an American television production company which is a subsidiary of CBS Entertainment Group unit of Paramount Global. It was formed on January 17, 2006, by CBS Corporation as CBS Paramount Television, as a renaming of the original incarnation of the Paramount Television studio. It is the television production arm of the CBS network (CBS Productions previously assumed such functions until 2004, when it was merged into Paramount Television), and, along with AT&T subsidiary WarnerMedia through its Warner Bros. Television Studios, it is also the television production arm of The CW (in which Paramount has a 50% ownership stake).\n\n\n== Background and timeline ==\n\n\n=== CBS ===\nIn 1952 the Columbia Broadcasting System formed an in-house television production unit, CBS Productions (commonly referred to as The CBS Television Network), as well as facilities in the newly established Television City in the Fairfax District, Los Angeles in Westside.  Also formed is CBS Television Film Sales (later known as CBS Films) as the distributor of off-network and first-run syndicated programming to local television stations in the United States and abroad.\nIn 1963, CBS Studio Center is established in Studio City, Los Angeles district of Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley. Later in 1971, CBS Films is spun off as Viacom International, Inc. The company is re-established as CBS, Inc., in 1974. In 1978, the production unit gained the secondary/alternate name CBS Entertainment Productions.\nIn 1994, Westinghouse Electric acquired CBS. Viacom merged with its creator CBS, in 1999.\n\n\n=== Paramount Pictures' early television ventures ===\nIn 1939, experimental television stations were established in Los Angeles (W6XYZ) as Television Productions Inc. and Chicago (W9XBK) with Balaban and Katz. Commercial broadcasting began in 1943 over WBKB in Chicago (now WBBM-TV). Commercial broadcasting began in 1947 over KTLA in Los Angeles. In 1949, the first major studio to establish program syndication as Paramount Television Network (much of which originated from KTLA). Paramount branched out of broadcasting in 1964 with the sale of KTLA to Gene Autry.\n\n\n=== Desilu Productions ===\nDesilu Productions formed in 1950 by Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball. Desilu Studios was established in Hollywood and Culver City in 1957, after Arnaz/Ball purchased the RKO Pictures studio lot. Desilu Sales Inc. was formed in 1962 as the company's syndication arm. In 1967, Desilu Productions was acquired by Gulf and Western Industries. The company becomes the TV division of Paramount Pictures Corporation in July, retaining the Desilu name until the end of that year. Desilu Sales, in turn, merges with Paramount's syndication division to become Paramount Television Sales.\n\n\n=== Paramount Television ===\nFrom 1966 to 1967, Gulf+Western acquired Paramount Pictures and Paramount Television Enterprises released 60 titles from their post-1949 feature film library to television broadcasters under the Paramount Portfolio I umbrella package. In 1968 Paramount Television, formerly Desilu, was established as the studio's television production unit. In 1977, Paramount Television Service was formed. In 1982 Paramount Television Group and Paramount Domestic Television and Video Programming was established. In September 1989, Gulf+Western was reincorporated as Paramount Communications, Inc.. On March 11, 1994, Viacom acquired Paramount Communications, resulting in the formation of Paramount/Viacom as a byline for several of Viacom's subsidiaries. In 1995, Viacom launched the United Paramount Network (UPN) with Chris-Craft Industries.\n\n\n=== CBS Paramount Television ===\nOn August 10, 2004 Viacom merged the international television banners of CBS Broadcast International and Paramount International Television to form CBS Studios International. On September 7, 2004, Viacom merged CBS Productions and Paramount Network Television to form a new entity of Paramount Network Television, aka the CBS Paramount Television Entertainment Group, with CBS Productions becoming an in-name only unit.On January 1, 2006, when the CBS/Viacom split took effect, CBS inherited Paramount's television program library, with the second Viacom keeping Paramount's films, the MTV Networks and the BET Networks. On January 17, 2006, CBS Corporation CEO Les Moonves announced that Paramount Television would be renamed CBS Paramount Television as of that day, with both the CBS 'eyemark' and Paramount's mountain united in the new logo, and the network division becoming CBS Paramount Network Television, and the domestic distribution arm becoming CBS Paramount Domestic Television. On July 17, 2006, Jeffrey Kramer, who was formerly employee of David E. Kelley Productions, started a company called Juniper Place Productions, which was affiliated with the studio.On September 26, 2006, CBS Corporation merged its television distribution arms\u2014King World, CBS Paramount International Television and CBS Paramount Domestic Television\u2014to form CBS Television Distribution (CBSTVD). CBS Home Entertainment was then established as a subsidiary of the latter. On January 25, 2007, CSI producers Carol Mendelsohn and Ann Donahue had reupped their deal with the studio. In 2008, 90210 and The Cleaner began using the CBS Productions logo in place of CBS Paramount's, becoming a legacy in-name only credit for the studio that lasted until 2012 for most of the newer shows.On May 17, 2009, CBS quietly drops the Paramount name after a 3+1\u20442-year loan of its use from the sister company Viacom, forming CBS Television Studios.\n\n\n=== CBS Television Studios ===\n\nCBS Paramount Television was the only CBS division that used the Paramount name and logo in its own name and logo (Paramount Pictures was owned by the post-2006 Viacom that was spun off from CBS, which was once known as the first Viacom). All three of its original divisions had used Paramount in their name: CBS Paramount Network Television (the production arm), CBS Paramount Domestic Television (the US distribution arm), and CBS Paramount International Television (the international distribution arm). When the companies split, CBS had permission to use the Paramount name for three years. The contract expired in 2009, and thus the Paramount name was gone from television for good, after 42 years as a production company (39 as Paramount Television), and before that, the owners of two early television stations (KTLA and WBBM-TV), an earlier production company (Telemount Productions), and part-owners of the DuMont Television Network until its revival in 2013 now running as Paramount Television Studios. Though on May 16, 2009, the network arm became CBS Television Studios, going in line with the distribution arm of the studio. Although most of the new shows carried the CBS Productions logo such as 90210, Melrose Place, The Good Wife and Three Rivers, the new CBS Television Studios logo would be used on new seasons of existing TV shows such as the CSI and NCIS franchises. Though in 2012, most of the new shows dropped the legacy CBS Productions logo entirely, replaced by CBS Television Studios' own logo.National Amusements retained majority control of both CBS and the second Viacom. For a short time, many of Paramount's theatrical films were distributed domestically by CBS Television Distribution (the new name for the distribution arm as of 2007).  Paramount Home Entertainment continues to distribute home video sales of CBS shows through the CBS DVD brand.\nThe studio had an output deal with Australia's Network 10, in which Ten receives first airing rights to the studio's productions. The deal ended after Network Ten's administration and later acquisition by CBS in 2017, giving Ten acquisition rights through now-owner CBS Studios International.\nUntil recently in the U.S., King World distributed its product independently from CBS Paramount Domestic Television, while internationally CBS Paramount International Television handled distribution and sales. As of September 16, 2007, the CBS Television Distribution logo appears after shows that had been distributed by King World.\nFrom 2009 until 2011, all shows produced by the company aired on either CBS or The CW. In the past, Paramount Television produced shows for all networks, but especially had a good relationship with ABC (much as Universal Television had a good relationship with eventually sister network NBC). The Cleaner, which aired on A&E until September 2009, was the most recent show from the company to air on a network other than CBS or the CW (which is ironic when NBC/ABC's ownership of A&E is taken into account). This was until BET began airing new episodes of The Game in 2011. In 2012, USA Network began airing Common Law.\nCTS does not directly produce any shows appearing on Showtime, a premium cable television network co-owned with the studio. Instead, sister company Showtime Entertainment handles in-house productions for the network. However, CTD and its international arm handle syndication distribution for these shows if they ever appear in syndication.\nOn June 10, 2010, two former Sony-affiliated producers Eric and Kim Tannenbaum (of The Tannenbaum Company) and Sarah Timberman and Carl Beverly (of Timberman/Beverly Productions) inked a deal with the studio to produce new shows.On October 25, 2018, CBS Television Studios announced the opening of a new animation division named CBS Eye Animation Productions. A new Star Trek series entitled Star Trek: Lower Decks was announced at the same time.In January 2019, Disney+ ordered Diary of a Future President from CBS Television Studios, its first series from an outside production company.It was announced on August 14, 2019, that parent company CBS Corporation would reunite with Viacom into a combined media company and be renamed ViacomCBS. For the first time in 13 years, ViacomCBS will encompass Paramount's film studio, the current incarnation of its television division and CBS's production studio under one umbrella.\n\n\n=== CBS Studios ===\nOn October 8, 2020, it was announced that CTS had been renamed CBS Studios as part of a unification of branding elements between CBS divisions, citing that use of the word \"

Andrus Wildlife Management Area in his honor. In 2018, the Cecil D. Andrus\u2013White Clouds Wilderness was renamed after him. A political liberal, he protected the environment by minimizing the control of business interests held over the public domain and by concentrating decision-making in the hands of experts in the Interior Department. He argued that environmentalism can and must coexist with positive economic development.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Hood River, Oregon on August 25, 1931, Andrus was the middle of three children of Hal Stephen and Dorothy May (Johnson) Andrus, with older brother Steve and younger sister Margaret.

The need for the college arose as a result of a change in the Government's education policy. The multipurpose scheme was given up in favor of the Junior college systems\nThe interest shown by the chief Minister Mr. Vengal Rao, led to the grant of a piece of land in Ranga Reddy District and LFJC began to take shape.

He is the club's longest serving manager, lasting a decade in the manager's seat between November 1958 and November 1968. He took charge of Leicester for a club record 508 matches, after making 111 appearances for the club as a player.\nHe was manager of the Leicester side nicknamed the 'Ice Kings', which chased the double in 1962\u201363.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nGillies played for R.A.F. Weeton, Bolton Wanderers and Leicester City, making a total of 248 appearances in the Football League.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\n\n\n=== Leicester City ===\nGillies took a brief break from football after finishing his playing career at Leicester in the summer of 1955, but returned to the club less than a year later to become part of the club's coaching staff under Dave Halliday in April 1956, before being made the club's manager on 1 November 1958.In 1959, Gillies signed then-unknown 22-year-old goalkeeper Gordon Banks from Chesterfield for just \u00a37,000. He also signed club stalwarts Dave Gibson, Mike Stringfellow, Lenny Glover and Derek Dougan. He was known as a fine nurturer and scout of young talent, bringing along Peter Shilton, Frank McLintock, Graham Cross and David Nish.\nGillies took over the Foxes on 8 November 1958 as they sat bottom of the First Division and amidst fan unrest after his predecessor David Halliday had recently sold star striker Arthur Rowley to Shrewsbury Town. He brought in Bert Johnson as his assistant and head scout and the pair would embark in arguably the most successful period in the club's history.Gillies managed to keep Leicester up in his opening season, but could only manage the signings of Albert Cheesebrough and Gordon Banks (originally signed as back-up) in the summer of 1959, as the majority of his transfer bids were rebuffed, while scouting missions to watch the young Huddersfield Town striker Denis Law saw him give an unimpressive performance on two separate occasions and Leicester again struggled at the beginning of the season. However, an injury to first choice goalkeeper Dave MacLaren in September, saw Gordon Banks come on for his replacement and within a month he had established himself as the first choice goalkeeper. Gillies also promoted a young Frank McLintock from the reserves around the same time and although both players made an instant impact and were being touted as stars of the future, it took until December until Leicester's season picked up, eventually finishing in a very respectable 12th position.Leicester continued to improve under Gillies and the following season, they finished 6th in the league, the club's highest league finish since finishing league runners-up in 1928\u201329. The club also reached the 1961 FA Cup Final in which they faced a Tottenham Hotspur side chasing the double. Gillies made the sensational decision to drop striker Ken Leek who had scored in every round of Leicester's cup run due to his drinking problems. In the final itself Len Chalmers received an injury early in the game and had to hobble for the remaining 70 minutes or so, meaning Leicester were effectively down to 10 men and Leicester went down 2\u20130 as Tottenham clinched the double. Though this did mean Leicester had qualified for Europe for the first time in their history. The club were knocked out in the first round of the European Cup Winners' Cup though 3\u20131 on aggregate to eventual winners Atl\u00e9tico Madrid after beating Glenavon 7\u20133 on aggregate in the Preliminary Round.\nTwo seasons later, in 1962\u201363, in what is considered Gillies' and often the club's peak, Leicester remarkably chased the double themselves, not only did they reach the FA Cup Final but they also sat top of the First Division with just 5 games to go. The worst winter for 2 decades led to a plethora of games being postponed. During these postponements Leicester quietly climbed the league in a then club record 18 match unbeaten run earning them the nickname in the national press of \"

The structure, which was briefly the headquarters of Carshalton Urban District Council before becoming a public library, is a Grade II listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing a significant increase in population, largely associated with the growing importance of the area as a residential suburb of London, the area became an urban district in 1894. The new urban district council initially rented premises in the High Street. In the early 20th century, civic officials, led by the clerk to the council, Charles Lovelock, launched an initiative to raise funds for purpose-built council offices. The site they selected, on the west side of The Square, had formed part of the grounds of All Saints Church.The foundation stone for the new building was laid by the chairman of the council, Councillor C. W. Edwards, on 21 December 1906. It was designed by R. Frank Atkinson and W. Willis Gale in the Baroque Revival style, built in red and blue bricks with stone dressings at a cost of \u00a32,500 and was completed in 1908. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with five bays facing onto The Square; the central section bay featured a doorway flanked by banded pilasters supporting an entablature, which was broken by a large keystone, and an open segmental pediment. There was a casement window flanked by stone scrolls on the first floor. The other bays were fenestrated by cross-windows on the ground floor and by casement windows on the first floor. At roof level, there was a modillioned cornice.Within a few years the civic leaders decided that the building was too small and Lovelock persuaded the lord of the manor, Blake Taylor, to sell land including The Grove and the rest of the area around the upper ponds to the council. By the mid-1920s, the council had relocated its offices to The Grove. The old council offices in The Square were converted for use as a library and a museum and were re-opened by the former member of parliament, Sir Thomas Worsfold, in January 1931. The museum failed to attract sufficient visitors and the collection was put into storage two years later. However, the building continued to serve the people of Carshalton as a public library until December 2012 when the library service relocated to the Westcroft Centre. The building then became a nursery but that also closed in 2020.\n\n\n== References =="

The league is in the third tier of American soccer and began play in 2019. NISA initially used a fall-to-spring season format with a winter break but have switched to spring-to-fall which is more common in the United States.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== League beginnings ===\n\nOn June 6, 2017, it was announced that the newly formed National Independent Soccer Association would begin play in 2018 targeting an initial 8 to 10 teams, later revised to 8 to 12 teams. Initially, the league outlined plans to introduce a promotion/relegation system, once they reach their goal of 24 teams, the first in US professional soccer and in doing so act as a feeder league to the North American Soccer League (NASL); however, the NASL ceased operations prior to those plans being implemented.\nOn February 13, 2018, NISA co-founder Jack Cummins died suddenly. On May 17, 2018, NISA co-founder Peter Wilt left the NISA to help start up Forward Madison FC in Madison, Wisconsin in USL League One.

On February 16, 2019, NISA was provisionally sanctioned as a Division III league by the United States Soccer Federation. In May 2019, it was announced that clubs were not happy with the silence from the league and that Bob Watkins was no longer the President of NISA and that John Prutch had taken the helm as commissioner. During this same timeframe, the league's start date was pushed back from August 2019 to a targeted September start date.On June 10, 2019, it became known that both Miami FC and California United Strikers FC were approved at the recent board of governors meeting to join NISA, while the previously identified club in Central Florida would play in Baton Rouge, Louisiana instead of Daytona Beach, Florida.

On August 15, 2019, the league officially announced the addition of Oakland Roots for the 2019 season and Chattanooga FC, Detroit City FC, and Michigan Stars FC for early 2020.The inaugural season began on August 31, 2019, with a 3\u20133 draw for Oakland Roots SC and California United Strikers FC in Oakland. On April 27, 2020, following previous postponements, the remainder of the 2019\u201320 season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.On September 10, 2020, the league announced that one of the original co-founders of the league, Peter Wilt, would be rejoining the league in a club operations capacity by attempting to establish a club in Chicago. On September 15, 2020, one of the founding teams, Oakland Roots, announced that they were leaving the league to join the USL Championship a league in the second division of professional soccer.\n\n\n=== Development of the amateur and semi-professional game ===\nOn April 27, 2020, NISA revealed a new tournament called the NISA Independent Cup that would have member teams face off against high quality amateur and independent professional sides in a regional format.

The partnership is set to provide a pathway to professional status for both clubs and players, while also allowing two GCPL teams to qualify for future editions of the Independent Cup based on league play. This was expanded to include the Midwest Premier League and Eastern Premier Soccer League on September 3 and 4, 2020, respectively. On November 23, NISA announced a fourth agreement with the Mountain Premier League.On September 17, 2020, the league announced that it was establishing a full-year amateur league, the NISA Nation, that would serve as an incubator for amateur and semi-professional clubs that wish to move into NISA's professional league.

Founded in 1869, today it has more than 2,000 members, drawn from the city's professional and business community. The club's main building is designated as a Category I historic building by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Northern Club was founded by a group of prominent professional and business men in 1867 when the idea of gentlemen's clubs was at its peak throughout the British Empire. The club's founders agreed to purchase a handsome quarrystone building overlooking Albert Barracks in Princes Street.The four-storey building, a high-rise in its own time, was originally designed as a hotel and was built on the first section sold at Auckland's inaugural land sale in 1841.  Following the purchase, architect Edward Ramsey was commissioned to rearrange the hotel's internal rooms for use by the club's 120 founding members.\nIn 1991, the club voted to admit women and today has a membership of both men and women. Membership of the Northern Club attracted many leaders of the Auckland community, and the club has played an active and sometimes pivotal role in the history of New Zealand's largest city. In 2010, the Northern Club absorbed the Auckland Club, adding over NZ$3 million in assets to the club, and some 250 members.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Northern Club building has a long history of association with Auckland's social elite. Built in 1867 as the Royal Hotel, it became a gentlemen's club two years later. Originally designed by Edward Mahoney, the three-storeyed building was located in a prestigious part of the settlement, close to the former Government House and provincial council. It was erected in a fashionable Italianate style, the brick structure being rendered externally to appear masonry-built. As the Royal, it replaced a timber structure of the same name and gained a reputation as the grandest establishment in town. Early tenants included the provincial government, which rented rooms as offices, and the Auckland Institute and Museum, while part of the first floor was a British Army officers' mess used by soldiers from the nearby Albert Barracks.\nThe Northern Club purchased the building in 1869, the club having been formed earlier in the year. Gentlemen's clubs developed in nineteenth-century Britain, enabling social and business networks to be maintained. Early members of the club included a future Prime Minister, Julius Vogel (1835\u20131899), and prominent businessmen such as Thomas Russell (1830\u20131904) and David Nathan (1816\u20131886). Governors of the colony were among those invited as guests, reinforcing the exclusivity of the organisation. The club refurbished the interior, and in the process reinforced social divisions through the building's layout. Service rooms for employees were located in the basement and members' reception rooms on the ground floor, while personal servants were not allowed in the upper chambers, although exceptions were made for governors. \nExpansion to the facilities generally occurred during periods of economic boom. A new dining room and fifteen bedrooms were constructed at the rear of the building in 1883\u20131884, and accommodation for residential staff was added in the 1920s. Exclusively male in its membership for over 120 years, facilities for women were introduced only gradually. The first female member was admitted in 1990, shortly after the earliest woman after-dinner speaker, the Minister of Finance Ruth Richardson, who addressed the club in 1989. Today nearly 20 per cent of members are female.\nThe Northern Club building is significant as one of the oldest surviving clubs in Auckland, and one of the city's oldest hotels.
