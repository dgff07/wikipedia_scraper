"Kesar| Balaji Telefilms television series| StarPlus original programming| Indian television series| 2004 Indian television series debuts| 2007 Indian television series endings| Television shows set in Punjab, India| ","Kesar (saffron) is an Indian television serial that aired on Star Plus from 19 April 2004 to 31 May 2007. The story follows the life of a young girl named Kesar.\nThe series was supposed to go on air as Karvachauth on Zee TV. However, as things didn't work out between the channel and production house, it was later granted permission by Star Plus and it went on air as Kesar.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nKesar (Nandini Singh) is a traditional Punjabi girl living with her large extended family in a village. She gets an offer of marriage from the wealthy Maliya family, living in a big city. Kesar marries Rudra (Nikhil Arya), the son of the Maliyas. She tries her best to cope with the sophisticated urban lifestyle of her new family. But soon she finds herself trapped in a web of deceit. It is revealed that Rudra and his mother Pam have conspired against the innocent Kesar for the sake of some valuable inheritance. Kesar's life goes through a great deal of turmoil. She finds support from Rudra's friend Abhi, who loves her selflessly. But Abhi dies a tragic and early death. His heart is transplanted into the body of Harman (Yash Tonk), who begins to experience the same feelings of love for Kesar. Meanwhile, Kesar has given birth to Rudra's daughter Muskaan. Rudra dies in a bomb blast. After many more troubles, Kesar decides to marry Harman. However, they are separated by adverse circumstances.\nGoing through these vicissitudes, Kesar gets a new face and identity as Kavita (played by Prachi Shah). She marries Police Commissioner Arjun Gill and brings up Abhimanyu, his son from his first marriage, as her own. She continues to miss her daughter Muskaan and her adopted son Krish. Later on, Kesar is reunited with her daughter Muskaan. The secret that Kesar and Kavita are the same person comes out before everyone. Kesar continues to live with Arjun  and Muskaan. Krish lives with Harman. Harman is married to Nupur but remains good friends with Kesar.\nNupur becomes jealous of Harman and Kesar's relationship. Nupur tries to kill Kesar, but instead hurts Harman and he became blind. The only person to know this is Nupur and Harman's daughter Khwaish. Krish meets Khushali, and they fall in love. Muskaan and Rohan meet and fall in love too. On their engagement night, Kesar finds out Rohan's real name is Ajay and he was married before. Krish and Khushali get engaged but Muskaan and Rohan do not. Rohan leaves the house but tells everyone that he had already informed Muskaan about this truth in a CD. However, Muskaan never managed to watch it. Later, the misunderstanding is cleared up. Muskaan decides to get back with Rohan, but on her engagement night, she is almost strangled to death. The person who wants to kill Muskaan is Naina, her wedding planner. Naina has loved Rohan for a long time but he does not love her. On Muskaan and Rohan's wedding day, police arrest him for killing his first wife. Naina is actually the one who has killed Rohan's first wife. She gathers evidence against Rohan and shows it to the police, so that his marriage will be delayed. Kesar and Arjun support Rohan. They compel Naina to admit that she killed Rohan's first wife. Naina then commits suicide.\nMuskaan and Rohan get together. Then, on the day of their marriage, Muskaan refuses to marry Rohan. Abhimanyu is in love with Muskaan and has confessed his love for her. Then he rapes her. This matter is taken to court. Meanwhile, Nupur tells Harman that she is the reason behind his going blind. Nupur gets shot and dies. Then, one day, Arjun tries to kill Harman. The reason is that Arjun is jealous of Harman's friendship with Kesar. However, Harman tells Arjun that his eyes have healed and he can see. Arjun is shocked to hear this. Kesar then brings the police and they arrest Arjun. Meanwhile, Muskaan and Rohan have got married. But Rohan beats up Muskaan, because he thinks that she and Abhimanyu are having an affair. When Rohan realises that it is not so, he apologises to Muskaan, but she doesn't forgive him. Muskaan and Kesar then move in with Harman, Krish, Khushali and Khwaish. They all live happily in Harman's house.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nNandini Singh as Kesar Rudra Maliya  / Kesar Abhinav Pandey / Kesar Rudra Maliya\nNandini Singh as Dr. Kangana Husband Dr Rudra Maliya (Kesar's Look Alike)\nPrachi Shah as Kesar Abhinav Arjun Gill / Kavita Face Surgery\nEijaz Khan as Abhinav (Abhi) Pandey\nYash Tonk as Harman Khanna\nNikhil Arya as Rudra Maliya\nSandiip Sikcand / Shakti Singh as Parmeet\nIndira Krishnan as Teji\nMadan Joshi as Dharam Maliya\nSurekha Sikri as Saroj Dharam Maliya\nKitu Gidwani / Natasha Rana as Pam Vikram Maliya\nRocky Verma as Inspector Yashwant Patil\nKaran Patel as Ryan Sood\nKanika Kohli as Nitika Maliya / Nitika Ryan Sood\nHiten Tejwani as Abhinav (Abhi) Pandey\nNisha Rawal as Binita\nAleeza Khan / Ashita Dhawan as Neha\nGunjan Walia as Riya Maliya\nShubhangi Gokhale as Harman's Aunt\nKhyaati Khandke Keswani as Katrina Rudra Maliya\nShivalika Sharma as Nupur Harman Khanna\nNishant Shokeen as Aseem\nVineet Sharma as Shivam\nIqbal Azad as  Police Commissioner Arjun Gill\nShweta Rastogi as Muskaan Maliya\nAmit Dolawat as Krish Maliya\nAshish Sharma as Abhimanyu Gill\nGunjan Vijaya as Khwaish Khanna\nAnkita Bhargava as Khushali\nPoonam Gulati as Naina\nVishal Watwani as Anand Pandey (Abhinav's Younger Brother)\nPratima Kazmi as Shakuntala Pandey (Abhinav & Anand's Mother)\nSanjay Batra as Vikram Maliya\nSonali Verma as Reema Vikram Maliya\nJaya Bhattacharya as Reema Sood\nKavita Kaushik as Kadambari Abhinav Pandey\nNasirr Khan as Komal\nAnas Rashid as Dr. Sahil\nMonalika Bhonsle as Shalini Sood\nMazher Sayed as Dr. Walia\nShweta Tiwari as Prerna\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKesar at IMDb\nOfficial website on TV Asia\nOfficial website on STAR Plus"
"MMP14| Genes on human chromosome 14| Matrix metalloproteinases| EC 3.4.24| Human chromosome 14 gene stubs| ","Matrix metalloproteinase-14 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the MMP14 gene.\n\n\n== Function ==\nProteins of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. Deficits in MMP14 leads to premature aging, short lifespan, and cell senescence in mice, suggesting an important role of MMP14 in extracellular matrix remodeling during aging. Most MMP's are secreted as inactive pro-proteins which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases.\nHowever, the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the membrane-type MMP (MT-MMP) subfamily; each member of this subfamily contains a potential transmembrane domain suggesting that these proteins are tethered to the cell surface rather than secreted.\n\"
"Omandongo| Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Mission mission stations in Ondonga| Oshikoto Region| Geography of Namibia| ","Omandongo is an unpopulated place in the Onayena Constituency in the Oshikoto Region in Northern Namibia, and the region which used to be called Ovamboland.\nThe Finnish Missionary Society began its missionary work in Omandongo in 1870. This was the first mission station for Finnish missionaries in the whole world. It was occupied by Finnish missionaries during 1870\u201388.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first missionaries of the Finnish Missionary Society arrived in Omandongo on 9 July 1870 from Otjimbingwe in the Hereroland via Omaruru. Omandongo was part of the kingdom of the King Shikongo of Ondonga.\nWhen the Finns arrived there, there was one structure at Omandongo, a house that had been built by Frederick Green, assistant to the merchant Andersson. It had been donated to Carl Hugo Hahn of the Rhenish Mission, and he in turn gave it to the Finns.\nThe Finns who arrived in Omandongo were the following:\nNotes:\na Note: In official works of history the first term of these missionaries is given as having begun in 1868, because they arrived on 30 December that year in Cape Town and on to Stellenbosch on the same day.b Piirainen acted during 1874\u20131910 as the FMS representative in Omaruru in Hereroland.The Omandongo mission station had to be abandoned in late September or early October 1888, because of the despotic behaviour of Prince Nehale of Ondonga. His men murdered a South African merchant named William Jordan practically in the yard of the mission station. Nehale\u2019s men also tried to \u201cpurchase\u201d an ox cart from the Finns, apparently offering nothing as compensation. The Finns then fled to King Kambonde in Olukonda.\nIn Ondonga, the work of the missionaries soon expanded so that several new mission stations were founded. These were Olukonda (1871\u2013), Oniipa (1872\u201376, 1888\u2013), Ondjumba (1872\u201376) and Omulonga (1874\u20131888).Later also the following mission stations were founded in Ondonga: Ondangwa (1890\u20131913, from 1915 on a government station) and Ontananga (1900\u2013), Onayena (1902\u201306, 1907\u2013), Oshigambo (1908\u2013) and Onandjokwe (1910\u2013).Oniipa, Onandjokwe and Oshigambo had the longest life as mission stations. (The end of this history is not given here, since the sources used do not extend to the end of this the time period. These former mission stations continue as important centres of the activities of the ELCIN church.)\n\n\n== Festive occasions ==\n\n\n=== 30 year celebrations ===\nThe 30th anniversary of the arrival of the Finnish missionaries was celebrated at Olukonda, since Omandongo had been abandoned already years earlier. The festivities were conducted on 7 July 1900. Among those present was the director of the Finnish Missionary Society, the Rev. Jooseppi Mustakallio. The festivities were conducted out of doors, and there were 600 people present.\n\n\n=== Centennial celebrations ===\nThe centennial celebrations of missionary  work in Ovamboland were held at Omandongo in July 1970. There was a large wooden cross at the site, and the first number was a re-enactment of the arrival of the missionaries 100 years earlier. Several male missionaries, with their safari helmets on, acted the roles of the original arrivals on ox carts. Students of the Engela Parish Institute acted the part of the indigenes.It was estimated that at least 5500 persons participated, since there was a special badge on sale and this was the number of badges sold. But many people also were present without badges, according to various estimates 1000 persons or even 2000 persons.\nThe liturgy of the festive service was conducted by Mikko Iham\u00e4ki and Bishop Leonard Auala, and the sermon was held by Kleopas Dumeni. The festivities were led by the Rev. Matias Ngipandula.28 speeches were held at the festivities, 15 of which were interpreted to other languages. Seven choirs performed, and they sand altogether 18 songs. Among the performers was also the brass band of the Rhenish Mission youth. Five plays were also performed during the festivities.The festivities had an ecumenical aspect, as several Christian denominations were represented, among the not only Lutheran Ovambos but also Lutheran Hereros, belonging to a different church, as well as the Reformed Christian, Anglicans and Roman Catholics. The government of South Africa was represented by Chief Commissar J. M. de Wet, who emphasised that the Ovambos, the Boers and the Finns must work together in order to improve the situation of the OvambosEverything went peacefully, and the biggest problem was caused by a couple of scorpion stings.The wooden cross at the site has since been burned, apparently as a wanton act.\n\n\n== Finns buried in Omandongo ==\nHenrik Rautanen (d. 1880).\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPeltola, Matti (1958).

It consists of a bronze rendition of Cort\u00e9s designed by Eduardo Barr\u00f3n on top of a stone pedestal.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nThe first one to come up with the idea of erecting a monument to Cort\u00e9s in Medell\u00edn was Carolina Coronado, formulating it as early as 1845, predating a 1858 public petition. However the realization of such plans would take decades. The project was eventually awarded to Eduardo Barr\u00f3n. The model of the statue was sculpted in Rome, although the bronze was cast in Barcelona. It was funded by the Provincial Deputation of Badajoz and the Spanish State. Meanwhile, the bronze, obtained from cannons, was financed by Carlos Groizard y Coronado.\n\nThe bronze statue of Cort\u00e9s is depicted wearing armor, stepping on some Mexica idols while raising the banner of the Cross.

In the 1980s, AST designed add-on expansion cards, and toward the 1990s evolved into a major personal computer manufacturer. AST was acquired by Samsung Electronics in 1997, but was forced to close in 1999 due to a series of losses.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Expansion cards ===\n\nAST's original business was the manufacture and marketing of a broad range of microcomputer expansion cards, later focusing on higher-density replacements for the standard I/O cards in the IBM PC. A typical AST multifunction card of the mid-1980s would have an RS-232 serial port, a parallel printer port, a battery-backed clock/calendar (the original IBM PC did not have one), a game port, and 384 KB of DRAM (added to the 256 KB on the motherboard to reach the full complement of 640 KB) - marketed under the product name 'SixPakPlus'. A similar expansion card was produced for the 8-bit Apple II, named the AST Multi I/O, which offered a serial and parallel interface, plus a battery-backed clock/calendar.\nIn 1987, AST produced a pair of expansions cards for the Apple IIGS computer: The RamStakPlus, a dual RAM/ROM memory expansion card; and the AST Vision Plus, a real-time video digitizer card. The latter card was eventually sold to Silicon & Software and licensed and sold through Virtual Realities (and later LRO and then Alltech Electronics). AST Research also produced for the Macintosh line the Mac286, a pair of NuBus cards containing an Intel 80286 and RAM, allowing a Macintosh to run MS-DOS side by side with its existing operating system. These cards were announced in March 1987 alongside Apple's Macintosh II line. The product line was eventually sold to Orange Micro, which developed the concept further.\n\n\n=== Personal computers ===\n\nAs PC manufacturers improved the integration of peripheral controllers on their motherboards, AST's original business began to shrink, and the company developed its own line of PCs, for the desktop, mobile, and server markets.\nAST was one of the members of the Gang of Nine which developed the EISA bus.\nIn 1992, AST became a Fortune 500 company at place 431.\nAST computer's reliability was considered close to that of quality leaders Compaq, Gateway, and IBM. AST gained a decent share of the PC market, but never came close to overtaking Compaq and Dell. During 1992\u20131995, AST owned the largest market share in China with Legend (now Lenovo) as the largest local reseller of AST computer.\nIn 1993, Radio Shack sold its computer manufacturing division to AST, and in 1994 they reached a deal to sell AST computers in Radio Shack stores. A year later, the electronics chain started selling IBM-brand computers instead.\n\n\n=== Decline ===\nAST's fortunes shrunk due to the strategy of offering premium models in an increasingly competitive personal computer market, while Compaq Computer Corporation and other top-tier manufacturers slashed prices to go head-to-head with the cheapest clones. The failure of AST to recognize the movement towards the commoditization of the PC contributed to its downturn.  AST insisted on developing and using its own components in the PCs it produced, instead of those of specialized OEMs. One often used saying at AST, in an attempt to dismiss such competitors, was \"

"State_Supplementation_Program| Government aid programs| Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program| ","The State Supplement Program (SSP or SSI/SSP), not to be confused with SNAP, is the state supplement to the U.S. federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program and provides state funded supplement benefits to SSI recipients.This program aims at providing a complementary financial support to individuals and couples who are elderly (usually 65 years of age and older), legally blind, or partially or fully disabled. The financial support can be considered as a global support, as it is not tied to any kind of expense. It can be used in a variety of ways, from housekeeping once in a while to daily residential care for individuals for who certain everyday tasks are difficult or impossible to do by themselves.However, very few states apply the exact same criteria of eligibility as the federal ones. The states who do let the Social Security Administration manage their SSP (see section Apply for the State Supplement Program). \nExcept from the states of Arizona, Mississippi, North Dakota, Northern Mariana Islands, and West Virginia; every state currently offers a state supplement to the federal SSI through the State Supplement Program. The conditions of eligibility to the supplement and the amount vary between the different states. The amount of the SSP ranges from $10 to $400 depending on the state. In 2020, the maximum amount of the SSI is $783 per month for an eligible individual, and $1175 for an eligible couple.\n\n\n== Usual State Supplementation Program eligibility criteria ==\nSSP eligibility criteria vary between states but we can identify the following as being the most commun:\n\nGrandfathered SSI recipients;\nIndividuals with an ineligible spouse;\nSSI recipients who are over age 65;\nSSI recipients who are blind or disabled;\nIndividuals determined eligible for SSP by the Developmental Disabilities Administration; or;\nCertain individuals who are eligible for SSI and are in foster care \n\n\n== State Supplementation Program amount variation factors ==\nThe amount paid to an eligible person will be calculated based on the following factors:\n\nliving arrangements,\nincome; and\ncounty of residenceThese primary factors serve as a base to determine individual needs. The states who administer the SSP themselves may use additional factors to determine the amount which will be paid.\n\n\n== Apply for the State Supplement Program ==\nThe application for the SSP has to be done to the state directly.\nIn some states however, no application is necessary as the state supplement is administered by the Social Security Administration. The Social Security Administration will determine the eligibility of the citizens in these states and pay the SSP along with the SSI. The states for which the SSP is administered by the Social Security Administration are the following: California, Hawaii, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, and Vermont.\nIn these states, only one payment is made to include both the SSI and the SSP, combining federal and state benefits.\nIn some states, SSP is dually administrated. Social Security administers some categories of State supplement payments, while the State administers other categories of supplemental payments. The states with a dual administration of the SSP are Delaware, District of Columbia, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. It is therefore necessary to check with the state if is eligible to the SSP under the federal or state criterions.\n\n\n== Amount of the benefits when the State Supplement Program is partially or fully administered by the Social Security Administration in 2020 ==\n\n\n== End of the benefits of the State Supplement Program ==\nA person will benefit from the State Supplement Program for as long as they fit the eligibility criterions set by the state. The payments will automatically stop if they do not fit the criterions anymore. Furthermore, any change in a person\u2019s living arrangements must be reported to the authority issuing the payments and can lead to an adjustment of the amount paid to the person. \nShould a person not be eligible to receive the SSI anymore, they will not be a part of the SSP as well as the SSP is a complementary program to the federal Supplementary Security Income program.\n\n\n== Specificities by state (non exhaustive list) ==\n\n\n=== Massachusetts ===\nIt is possible not be to eligible for SSI but to be eligible for Massachusetts\u2019 SSP. That is because the maximum income to be eligible for SSP in Massachusetts is higher than the one set for the federal SSI.\nHowever, in order to apply for the SSP, it is needed to apply for SSI first even a person is not eligible for the SSI but only for the SSP.\nBenefits are paid at the beginning of each month.\n\n\n=== New Hampshire ===\nEligibility criteria in New Hampshire are the following:\n\nbeing a resident of 65 years of age or older;\nbeing a resident between the ages of 18 and 64, and is determined by the State to be physically or mentally disabled, partially or fully; and\nbeing a resident of any age who is determined by the State to be legally blind.\n\n\n== References =="

Her research makes use of remote sensing technology to understand the characteristics of plant communities.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nUstin is from Eugene, Oregon. After graduating from high school in 1961, Ustin moved to San Francisco with her friends. She was inspired by the city's activism, in particular the civil rights movement and environmental advocates. She first studied biology at California State University, East Bay, specialising in plant physiological ecology. She remained there for a master's degree, before moving to the University of California, Davis for her doctoral degree. Alongside her doctoral research Ustin started working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. She started working on remote sensing technology in the early 1980s, when the field was then in its infancy.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nHer work considers remote sensing of environmental and landscape properties, making use of hyperspectral analysis and thermal scanners. Remote sensing has since been used to monitor natural disasters, study climate changes and monitor air pollution. Over the course of her career, Ustin made use of remote sensing data from five different continents, including tracking the impacts of agriculture on forests and monitoring invasive plant species.Ustin held several positions at University of California, Davis, including serving as Director of both the Center for Spatial Technology and Remote Sensing and the John Muir Institute of the Environment. She worked with NASA to build space-based imaging spectrometers.\nIn 2020 Ustin was elected to the Ecological Society of America. Her citation read, \u201cElected for research pioneering the use of remote sensing technology for detecting changes in plant community characteristics, biological diversity, and land use, and for her continued influence on the field,\u201d.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2010 Honorary Doctorate from the University of Zurich\n2017 Elected Fellow of the American Geophysical Union\n2020 Elected Fellow of the Ecological Society of America\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nRoberts, D.A.; Gardner, M.; Church, R.; Ustin, S.; Scheer, G.; Green, R.O.

"Holcomb_Valley| Mining in California| Valleys of San Bernardino County, California| San Bernardino Mountains| Gold mining| American gold rushes| Valleys of California| ","Holcomb Valley, located in the San Bernardino Mountains about five miles north of Big Bear Lake, was the site of the most gold mines in Southern California. It was named after William F. Holcomb, who found gold there in 1860. That year started the largest gold rush in the Southern California region.  The boomtown of Belleville grew up near there and flourished for about ten years before being abandoned. The site is now registered as California Historical Landmark #619.\n\n\n== Gold ==\nIn May 1860, gold was found there by William F. Holcomb and Ben Choteau.  They were miners who had been prospecting at Bear Valley. Holcomb found gold while he was tracking a bear in the valley later named after him. After Holcomb and Ben Ware filed mine claims on five sites in May 1860 at the County Recorder's office, word spread quickly and prospectors rushed to the area.Before long, a gold camp sprang up within 150 inches of where the gold was found. It became a town and, after the first child Belle was born, the new town was named Belleville in her honor. It soon became the largest town in San Bernardino County with a population of about 1,500. \nOften perpetuated by local newsmen, is the myth that Belleville was almost once the County seat. The story goes that Belleville residents felt they deserved the honor of being the county seat and placed this measure on the ballot in either 1860 or 1861. After the election, ballots were being counted at the County Court House (in San Bernardino City) around an open bonfire when one of the ballot boxes, allegedly from Belleville, was accidentally, kicked into the fire and destroyed. When the count was completed, Belleville had lost the county seat election by the slim margin of two votes. \nHowever, the California Constitution allows for a change in county seat only through legislative action in which it may directly decide the location, or delegate the authority to the voters of the county, which would require it to be placed on the local ballot. There was no legislative act on record in State Records to change the county seat from San Bernardino to Belleville, in any year, let alone 1860 or 1861. Any item up for election on the local ballot was required to be posted in the local newspaper. The only items published in both 1860 and 1861 were the names of the people running for office and school bonds. The items up for election are also required to be listed in the Board of Supervisor minutes, there is no such listing for the change of the County seat. Also there is no mention of the election or missing ballots in Holcomb's recollections which were written in the 1870s only a few years later at the behest of the San Bernardino Pioneer Society. \nBelleville was a place filled with rough characters competing over gold, it was considered a place of violence and hanging justice. It was the third and fourth largest town in Southern California during these yearsHolcomb Valley produced the most wealth from gold of any Southern California mining district. With time, major placer and quartz mining declined, followed by the departure of most of the population of Belleville after 1870. Hard rock mining continued at the Gold Mountain Mine until 1919.  Some mining activity continues today, with 2,000 claims by hobbyists.The valley is the site of the Holcomb Valley Scout Ranch (formerly of Old Baldy Council), on the site of the old Hitchcock Ranch. It provides opportunities for youth to have experience in ranching, hiking and related outdoor activities.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCalifornia Gold Rush\nThe Night of the Grizzly\nCalifornia Historical Landmarks in San Bernardino County, California\n\n\n== References =="

"City_Art_Centre| Art museums and galleries in Edinburgh| ","The City Art Centre is part of the Museums & Galleries Edinburgh, which sits under the Culture directorate of the City of Edinburgh Council. The City Art Centre has a collection which include historic and modern Scottish painting and photography, as well as contemporary art and craft. It is an exhibition based venue with no permanent displays.\nThe City Art Centre is home to the City of Edinburgh's Recognised collection of Scottish Art. Edinburgh's fine art collection is approximately 4,800 pieces of Scottish work in a variety of mediums. Artists such Fergusson, Eardley, Paolozzi are represented in the collection as well as many other Edinburgh based and Scottish artists. Artists are represented dating from the 17th century to the present day.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1971 the City Art Centre was housed in the former Royal High School. In 1975 the reform of the Scottish local government brought the City Museums and the City Art Centre together the new council directorate of the Recreation Department. The City Art Centre was then rehoused to its current Market Street location in 1980.The current City Art Centre building dates  from 1899 to 1902  and was the work of  Dunn and Findlay. Built as an extension to the Scotsman newspaper office, it later became part of the city\u2019s wholesale fruit and vegetable market.\nDesigned as a nine storey iron-framed warehouse, it is clad in stone to create a restrained Beaux Arts facade. It has public galleries on 6 floors.\nThe original conversion of the building in 1980 was undertaken by the City Architect's Department under the direction of the then City Architect, Brian Annable, and it garnered a RIBA Award for Architecture in 1983. In the 1990s more  space was created by extending into  the upper floors. Natural materials and neutral colours are used  throughout the interior to create flexible contemporary exhibition spaces.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\nIn 1961 Miss Jean Watson, an Edinburgh resident, at first gave and then later bequeathed money to create a collection of Scottish Art for the City of Edinburgh. The fund is administered by the City Council and is still in use today. Soon after Miss Watson gave her initial sum of money, a Committee was formed to administer the funds. One of their first decisions was to commission a bronze bust of Miss Watson herself from a sculptor, Eric Schilsky. From the outset, the Committee opted to purchase contemporary works of art by Scottish artists or artists based in Scotland. One of their first purchases was Obsession by John Bellany. Since then, more than 900 paintings, drawings, sculpture, photographs and prints have been added.  Works by contemporary artists such as Moyna Flannigan, Calum Colvin, Peter Howson and Dame Elizabeth Blackadder have all been acquired with Bequest Funds.In 1964 more than 300 of the works owned by the Scottish Modern Arts Association were donated to the City of Edinburgh during the dissolution of the Scottish Modern Arts Association. These are now housed in the City Art Centre.\nThe Scottish Arts Council began collecting in 1951, with a focus on the purchase of artworks by contemporary Scottish based artists. In the mid 1990s the Scottish Arts Council took the decision to distribute its collection of approximately 2,000 works by contemporary Scottish artists to museums and galleries throughout Scotland. Institutions were given the opportunity to view the collection and submit proposals for acquisition, the City Art Centre applied and in 1998 received 123 works of art.Through the National Collecting Scheme for Scotland, six major museums and art galleries, including the City Art Centre, have been able to acquire new works by contemporary artists. The Scheme has been in operation since 2003, and was established to assist museums and galleries throughout Scotland purchase work by contemporary artists and craft makers. To avoid duplication, each member gallery is invited to collect within a broad theme. In recognition of Edinburgh\u2019s World Heritage Site Status, the City Art Centre is acquiring works all of which have an urban or architectural theme. Since the scheme began, the City Art Centre have acquired a variety of work including film, photography and installation. Artists now represented include Toby Paterson, Christine Borland, Graham Fagen, Rosalind Nashashibi, Nathan Coley and Rose Frain.\nIn collaboration with Edinburgh Libraries, the Museums & Galleries Edinburgh show their collection on Capital Collections. Capital Collections is an image library which allows a selection of collections to be viewed.\n\n\n== References =="

"Toggenburg| Toggenburg| ","Toggenburg is a region of Switzerland. It corresponds to the upper valley of the river Thur and that of its main tributary, the Necker. Since 1 January 2003, Toggenburg has been a constituency (Wahlkreis) of the canton of St. Gallen (SFOS number 1727).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe valley descends in a northwestern direction from the watershed between the Rhine and the Thur, and is enclosed on the northeast by the chain of the S\u00e4ntis (8,216 ft [2,504 m]) and on the southwest by that of the Churfirsten (7,566 ft [2,306 m]) and of the Speer (6,411 ft [1,954 m]). It is a fertile valley of about 45 kilometres (28 mi) in length from the source of the river to Wil.At Wildhaus, the highest village (3,632 ft [1,107 m]), the house wherein Huldrych Zwingli, the Swiss Reformer, was born in 1484, is still shown. Other villages are Lichtensteig, Kirchberg and Wattwil.\n\n\n== History ==\nThere are traces of the paleolithic Mousterian Industry throughout the Appenzell Alps, in the Toggenburg notably in Wildenmannlisloch cave.\nThe upper Thur valley was part of the province of Raetia in the Roman era, and was reached by Alemannic-speaking settlers only in the early medieval period. This is evidenced by a substantial substrate of Romance toponyms in the upper Toggenburg (upstream of Stein).The name of the region is derived from that of the House of Toggenburg (named for their castle near Kirchberg) who ruled over parts of the Toggenburg region since the 12th century, in the 13th century taking the title of counts (comes) and extending their domain to include all of the upper Thur valley.\nThe extinction of the main line of the counts of Toggenburg  (1436) led to the Old Z\u00fcrich War (1440\u201346) ultimately resulting in the temporary expulsion of Z\u00fcrich from the Swiss confederacy. Eventually, the Toggenburg passed to the lord of Raron (in Valais), who sold it to the abbot of St. Gall in 1468.Part of the Toggenburg followed the Swiss Reformation led by Zwingli, and the valley declared itself independent in 1530, but was forced to re-submit to the Abbot of St. Gall in 1538. The Abbot was, however, pressured into toleration of either confession, so that the Toggenburg became one of the few regions of Switzerland where Catholicism and Protestantism have a tradition of co-existence.\nIn 1707, the Toggenburg again declared its independence of St. Gall, in reaction to the Abbey's plans to build a road across the Ricken Pass, which was seen as a strategic arrangement towards a Catholic military alliance. The ensuing Toggenburg war of 1712 resulted in a balance of power between Catholic and Protestant cantons, ultimately leading to the formation of Switzerland as a federal state.\nIn the Helvetic Republic, the Toggenburg was divided between the cantons of S\u00e4ntis and Linth. The parts were re-united as part of the canton of St. Gallen in 1803.\nSch\u00fcblig, a type of sausage is a tradition in the area.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe Toggenburg Wahlkreis has a population of 46,954 (as of 31 December 2020).

"Pueraria_montana| Pueraria| Taxa named by João de Loureiro| ","Pueraria montana is a species of plant in the botanical family Fabaceae. At least three sub-species (alternatively called varieties) are known. It is closely related to other species in the genus Pueraria (P. edulis and P. phaseoloides) and the common name kudzu is used for all of these species and hybrids between them. The morphological differences between them are subtle, they can breed with each other, and it appears that introduced kudzu populations in the United States have ancestry from more than one of the species.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIt is a seasonal climbing plant, growing high where suitable surfaces (trees, cliffs, walls) are available, and also growing as ground cover where there are no vertical surfaces. It is a perennial vine with tuberous roots and rope-like, dark brown stems to 20 m (65 ft) long. It grows up to 20 metres per year and can achieve a height of 30 metres. It has markedly hairy herbaceous stems.\nPueraria montana is native to East Asia, primarily subtropical and temperate regions of China, Japan, and Korea, with trifoliate leaves composed of three leaflets. Each leaflet is large and ovate with two to three lobes each and hair on the underside. The species can fix atmospheric nitrogen, which can supply up to 95% of leaf nitrogen to the plant in poor soils. Along the vines are nodes, points at which stems or tendrils can propagate to increase support and attach to structures. As a twining vine, kudzu uses stems or tendrils that can extend from any node on the vine to attach to and climb most surfaces. In addition, the nodes of the kudzu vine have the ability to root when exposed to soil, further anchoring the vine to the ground. The roots are tuberous and are high in starch and water content, and the twining of the plant allows for less carbon concentration in the construction of woody stems and greater concentration in roots, which aids root growth. The roots can account for up to 40% of total plant biomass.\n Flowers are reddish-purple and yellow, fragrant, similar to pea flowers, about 20\u201325 millimetres (0.79\u20130.98 in) wide and are produced at the leaf axis in elongated racemes about 20 centimetres (7.9 in) long. The flowering period extends from July through October. The fruit is a flat hairy pod about 8 centimetres (3.1 in) long with three seeds.\nKudzu's primary method of reproduction is asexual vegetative spread (cloning) which is aided by the ability to root wherever a stem is exposed to soil. For sexual reproduction, kudzu is entirely dependent on pollinators.Although kudzu prefers forest regrowth and edge habitats with high sun exposure, the plant can survive in full sun or partial shade. These attributes of kudzu made it attractive as an ornamental plant for shading porches in the Southeastern United States, but they facilitated the growth of kudzu as it became a \u201cstructural parasite\u201d of the southern states, enveloping entire structures when untreated and often referred to as \u201cthe vine that ate the south\u201d.\n\n\n== Subspecies and varieties ==\nPueraria montana var. chinensis (Ohwi) Sanjappa & Pradeep\nPueraria montana var. lobata (Willd.) Sanjappa & Pradeep\nPueraria montana var. thomsonii (Benth.) Wiersema ex D.B. Ward\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe Latin specific epithet montana refers to mountains or coming from mountains.\n\n\n== Invasive species ==\n\nThe natural range of Pueraria montana can be found in India, Myanmar, Indochina, China, Korea, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, the Pacific Islands, and in north Australia. In its native habitat, it and its closely related species occur across wide areas; the species have diverged genetically due to vicariance. Its invasiveness can be attributed to similarities between both native and newly invaded niches, effectively expanding its habitable range into areas with climates it may not be able to endure otherwise.Like other exotic species, the introduction to other areas is due to human actions. Seeds are spread by mammals and birds. Kudzu are plants adapted to drought. Only above ground portions are damaged by frost; thick storage roots grow as deep as 1 metre. It forms new perennial root crowns from stem nodes touching the ground.\nThe ecological requirements of the species are those of the subtropical and temperate habitat areas.In Europe, Pueraria montana grows in several places in the warm regions of Switzerland and Italy near Lake Maggiore and Lake Lugano.\nDuring World War II, kudzu was introduced to Vanuatu and Fiji by United States Armed Forces to serve as camouflage for equipment. It is now a major weed there.Pueraria montana is also becoming a problem in Queensland.\nIn the United States, Pueraria montana is extensively reported in the coastal states from eastern Texas to Florida, North to Maryland, as well as inland in Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Washington, D.C., and West Virginia. Since 2004, Kudzu has moved farther North along the Ohio River, appearing in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. Of all affected states, three in the southeast have the heaviest infestations: Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.\n\n\n== Effects on biodiversity ==\n\nDue to the aggressive, climbing nature of P. montana it often causes shading and death of native vegetation, resulting in a monoculture of P. montana. As P. montana spreads, it shades and crushes its competitors with its weight, eliminating everything in its path. As a result of growing over native plants and trees, it blocks their access of vital resources such as sunlight, killing off young vegetation. These result in dramatic reductions in native biodiversity at the local level.Other than the loss of biodiversity of plant species, P. montana may have a negative effect on animals. Many plant species that are suppressed by P. montana because of its uncontrolled and rapid growth negatively impacts some wildlife animals that have specific mutualisms or feeding relationships with these plant species. This potentially could lead to the death of certain animal species, specifically herbivores, that depend on some vegetation as a resource for both food and shelter. These are important factors that lead to habitat destruction and reduction in animal biodiversity.\n\n\n== Impacts of global changes ==\nChanges in the global environment such as higher CO2 levels, higher temperatures, greater rates of nitrogen deposition, and greater fragmentation of natural habitats are predicted to increase the spread of P. montana.\n\n\n=== Carbon dioxide ===\nKudzu is highly responsive to increased CO2 levels as it results in maximal leaf expansion, increase in leaf size, and an overall 12% increase in leaf production.  In turn, the plant has higher turgor pressure which results in the improvements in its growth potential. As the atmospheric CO2 concentration continues to rise, it is possible for the potential enhancement of P. montana\u2019s invasiveness.\n\n\n=== Temperature ===\nWith global warming, overnight temperatures tend to increase. Data collected in the United States over the past few decades showed a reduction in frost days, an earlier date for the last freeze in spring, and a later date for the first freeze in fall. These favour the spread of  P. montana.  \nThe northward distribution of P. montana is hypothesized to be limited by low temperatures. Cold temperatures cause their leaves to be killed off and their leaf expansion to be lagged. However, with the continuous rise in global temperature, it is predicted that P. montana will rapidly spread northward as a result of the increased number of warmer days.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nL.

The A350 follows a lower route through villages in the Blackmore Vale.  However, much traffic uses the hilltop route as an alternative because it is straighter and passes through fewer villages. Melbury Abbas is the only bottleneck on this road, where it dips down into the valley and becomes narrower. \nDorset County Council have considered bypass schemes, but none has got further than preliminary because Melbury Abbas village is surrounded by conservation land.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Melbury Abbas at Wikimedia Commons"

"Leaf_curl| Fungal tree pathogens and diseases| Viral plant pathogens and diseases| Stone fruit tree diseases| Leaf diseases| ","Peach leaf curl is a plant disease characterized by distortion and coloration of leaves and is caused by the fungus Taphrina deformans, which infects peach, nectarine, and almond trees.  T. deformans is found in the United States, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Peach leaf curl reduces the amount of leaves and fruit produced by peach and nectarine trees.\n\n\n== Affected species ==\nPeach leaf curl mainly affects peach, nectarine, and almond trees. Apricots are generally immune to peach leaf curl (instead, the major apricot diseases are blossom wilt and branch dieback caused by Monilinia fructicola in the spring and Eutypa lata in the summer). However, in an isolated case in Hungary in 2011, peach leaf curl was also identified in apricot trees.\n\n\n== Symptoms ==\nPeach leaf curl is a distinctive and easily noticeable fungal disease, and the severity of the symptoms depends on how early infection has occurred. Diseased leaves can usually be identified soon after they emerge from the bud, due to their red color and twisted shape. As the leaves develop, they become increasingly distorted, and ultimately thick and rubbery compared to normal leaves. The color of the leaves changes from the normal green to red and purple, until a whitish bloom covers each leaf. Finally, the dead leaf may dry and turn black before it is cast off. Changes in the bark are less noticeable, if at all. Fruit may fail to develop from diseased blossoms. Any fruit that does develop from a diseased tree is usually normal, but sometimes may also be affected, showing a reddish color.  Infected leaves fall early. The tree usually produces a second flush of leaves that is rarely diseased, except in an unseasonably cool and wet spring, because the fungus is not infectious at the normally higher temperatures in late spring and early summer.\n\n\n== Cause of peach leaf curl ==\nThe fungus T. deformans causes deformed young leaves, red blisters, and ultimately the whitish bloom that covers the leaf as the infection progresses. This white color is made of asci that break through the cuticle of the leaf. One ascus consists of eight ascospores that create conidia, which are ejected in early summer and spread by rain and wind. The fungus survives the winter on the surface of the host plant, such as on bark or buds. In late winter or early spring, rainwater washes spores into the buds as they burst. Once this happens, no treatment is effective. In the spring, about two weeks after blossom, new leaves emerging from the infected buds are infected by the conidia. The disease may not occur every year due to variation in temperature and rainfall. Specifically, for successful infection, the fungus requires wet winters, where rain (not fog or dew) wets the tree for more than 12.5 hours at temperatures below 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F). The fungus cannot grow at temperatures below 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Control of the disease ==\nVarious methods are applied.\n\nThe most effective method is to plant peach trees against a house wall under an overhanging roof, possibly covered by a mat during the winter, to keep winter rain from the buds before they burst (and incidentally to delay blossoming until spring frosts are over), until the temperature exceeds 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in the spring, deactivating the fungus.\nCommercially, spraying the leaves with fungicides is the most common control method. The toxicity of these fungicides means they are not legally available to noncommercial growers in some countries. Spraying should be done in the winter well before budding. If trees are not sprayed early enough, treatment is ineffective. Copper-based mixtures (such as Bordeaux mixture) and lime sulphur are two fungicides commonly used.\nPeach cultivars can be planted which show some resistance to peach leaf curl, or at least regenerate rapidly, such as the white-fleshed Peach 'Benedicte'. For nectarines, the cultivar Kreibich is reported to have some resistance.If a tree has peach leaf curl in a particular year, the disease will inexorably take its course, but measures can be taken to sustain the tree or maximize crop yield: protecting the tree from further rain at temperatures below 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F), applying greasebands around the trunk to protect from insect infestation spreading the disease; providing nitrogen and excess water to minimize stress on the tree; and thinning the fruit. It is unclear whether removal of infected leaves from the tree is beneficial. Removing the infected leaves and fruit after they fall to the ground is sometimes also suggested but superfluous if, in the following winter, fungicides or rain protection are applied.\n\n\n== History ==\nPeach leaf curl was first introduced in America in 1852 and has now spread all over the country. By 1947, the disease was costing the United States $2.5 to 3.0 million annually.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIndex Fungorum\nUSDA ARS Fungal Database\nRoyal Horticultural Society - Peach Leaf Curl\nTreatment of peach leaf curl"

"Ordinariate_for_the_Faithful_of_Eastern_Rite_in_Spain| Ordinariates for Eastern Catholic faithful| Eastern Catholicism in Spain| Catholic Church in Spain| Roman Catholic dioceses in Spain| Eastern Catholic dioceses| Eastern Catholic dioceses in Europe| ","The Ordinariate for the Faithful of Eastern Rite in Spain is an Ordinariate (pseudo-diocese) for all non-Latin Catholic faithful living in Spain who belong to the particular Churches sui iuris of any Eastern rite immediately subject to the Holy See.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was erected on 9 June 2016 by Pope Francis, who also named the current Archbishop of Madrid, Carlos Osoro Sierra, as its first Ordinary.Its creation was a response to the increase of Eastern Catholics in Spanish territory, until then spiritually assisted by the various local dioceses. The Spanish Episcopal Conference already had a pastoral care department for the faithful of oriental rites, who in 2003 drew up the document Orientations for the pastoral care of Eastern Catholics in Spain.The Ordinariate has jurisdiction over all the Catholic faithful of the Eastern rite who live in Spain and may appoint vicars general, having appointed the presbyter Andr\u00e9s Mart\u00ednez Esteban for that position. Like the Ordinariate for Eastern Catholics in France, the ordinary has a personal jurisdiction over the Eastern faithful that is cumulative with the diocesan bishops, from whom he must obtain consent for the decisions that pertain to their respective dioceses, and that retain secondary jurisdiction in minor matters (unlike other oriental ordinariates in what the ordinary has full jurisdiction). It must also require the consent of the primate and synods of the Eastern Churches in the decisions that involve them and obtain from them the clergy of the Ordinariate.Between May 2 and 4, 2017 the ordinary met with the priests of the 3 oriental rites present in Spain to advance in the constitution of the Ordinariate.\n\n\n== Territory ==\nThe Ordinariate has jurisdiction over the Catholic faithful of all Eastern rites living in Spain. Its seat is the city of Madrid.\n\n\n=== Eastern Catholic communities in Spain ===\nEastern Catholics in Spain are mainly from the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church and from the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, both of Byzantine rite. There are also communities of the Syro Malabar Catholic Church. A small Coptic Catholic community that existed in Spain no longer existed at the time of the erection of the Ordinariate, as its faithful migrated to other European countries.\n\n\n==== Romanian Greek-Catholic Church ====\nOn March 16, 2009 the Cardinal and Archbishop of Madrid Antonio Maria Rouco Varela appointed the priest Bogdan Vasile Buda as chaplain responsible for the Romanian community of Byzantine rite residing in the archdiocese of Madrid. In April 2009 he assigned a chapel of the parish of Our Lady of Sorrows in Madrid for the pastoral care of the Romanian faithful of the Byzantine rite of his archdiocese. The community is called Capelania Greco-Catolic\u0103 din Madrid Botezul Domnului (Baptism of the Lord). On March 1, 2012 Bogdan Vasile Buda was named archpriest (protopop) by the Cardinal Primate of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, Lucian Mure\u015fan, and by the archiepiscopal major synod, becoming the national leader of the Romanian Greek Catholic faithful and priests of Spain (Greco-Romanian Catholic Deanery (arciprestazgo) of Madrid).The archpriest has 8 priests serving two parishes and 6 chaplaincies:\nDiocese of Orihuela-Alicante: the chaplaincy is in the church of San Roque in Alicante, with masses once a month in the church of San Pedro and San Pablo de Torrevieja\nDiocese of Almer\u00eda: chaplaincy in the church of the Holy Family of Almer\u00eda (Sf\u00e2nta Familie)\nDiocese of Ciudad Real: in the church of the Remedios of Ciudad Real\nArchdiocese of Granada: existing since 2006, the priest serves in the communities of Castell de Ferro (parish church Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen), Motril (in the church of Carmen) and Granada (in the Virgen del Carmen church, which has a pastoral with gypsies)\nDiocese of Mallorca: a community in the Oratory of San Telm in Palma de Mallorca\n\nDiocese of Calahorra and La Calzada-Logro\u00f1o: Romanian Greek Catholic parish of San Nicol\u00e1s in Calahorra (Parohia Greco-Catolic\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103 Sf\u00e2ntul Nicolae)\nDiocese of Le\u00f3n: the Romanian Greek Catholic parish of Le\u00f3n (Pogor\u00e2rea Sf\u00e2ntului Spirit, in the church of the Railway Orphans of Le\u00f3n and in the chapel of Caritas Diocesana de Benavente).Minor communities without a resident priest exist in the dioceses of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Getafe and Zamora.\n\n\n==== Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church ====\nUkrainian Greek Catholic communities have two parishes (Barcelona and Huelva) and 23 priests in 14 Spanish dioceses:\nDiocese of Albacete\nDiocese of Almer\u00eda: community of Campohermoso\nArchdiocese of Barcelona: personal parish of Sant Josep, Santa M\u00f2nica and Sant Josafat\nDiocese of C\u00e1diz and Ceuta\nDiocese of Cartagena: community of Murcia\nDiocese of C\u00f3rdoba\nDiocese of Cuenca\nDiocese of Gerona\nArchdiocese of Granada: in the parish of Santo \u00c1ngel Custodio\nDiocese of Huelva: have since 2015 in the parish of Saints Cyril and Methodius its own temple on which depends the community of Seville (also with its own temple, the church of the Sisters of Mary Repairing)\nDiocese of Lleida\nArchdiocese of Madrid: Ukrainian chaplaincy with headquarters in the parish of Our Lady of Good Success with 2000 parishioners, on which the chaplaincies depend in the parishes of Santa Teresa de Jesus de Getafe and Virgen de Bel\u00e9n de Alcal\u00e1 de Henares\nDiocese of M\u00e1laga\nDiocese of Mallorca: Ukrainian chaplaincy in the church of Santa Fe in Palma de Mallorca\nDiocese of Orihuela-Alicante: community in Torrevieja\nArchdiocese of Pamplona\nDiocese of Solsona\nArchdiocese of Tarragona\nDiocese of Urgell\nArchdiocese of Valencia\nDiocese of Vic: communities in Torell\u00f3 and in Vic\nDiocese of Vitoria\nArchdiocese of ZaragozaBishop Hlib Lonchyna was apostolic visitor for Ukrainian Greek Catholics in Spain from March 4, 2004 until January 7, 2009. He was succeeded since January 19, 2009 by the titular bishop of Egnazia, Dionisio Lachovicz, as apostolic visitor in Italy and Spain, appointed by Pope Benedict XVI and based in Rome. In 2009 it was estimated that in Spain there were 42,000 faithful in 45 communities of Ukrainians of Byzantine rite, attended by 17 priests.\n\n\n==== Syro-Malabar Catholic Church ====\nIn Madrid there is the Syro Malabar community of Saint Thomas, with 80 members and a priest since 2009, and four other communities in Barcelona, Granada, Toledo and Valladolid, which together another 120 worshipers, ten priests and four nuns.\n\n\n== Ordinaries ==\nCarlos Osoro Sierra (since 2016.06.09)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGcatholic.org\nCatholic-hierarchy"

He was the uncle of Rasse of Gavre, 1st Marquess of Ayseau.\nIn 1601 he received from Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor the hereditary title of Prince de Ligne.\nAs a diplomat, the first Prince de Ligne was involved in many historic events of his time. He represented Archduke Albert of Austria and Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain at the French court of Henri IV of France, in Spain and again in Paris, to congratulate King Louis XIII of France with his marriage with the daughter of Philip III of Spain. During this mission, he discussed several issues with the French political leaders.\nIn 1621 Prince Lamoral I was made grandee of Spain by King Philip IV of Spain for his services rendered to the Crown.

"Festucalex_cinctus| IUCN Red List least concern species| Festucalex| Marine fish| Fish described in 1882| ","Festucalex cinctus (girdled pipefish or orange-cheek pipefish) is a species of marine fish of the pipefish family Syngnathidae which is endemic to the waters off eastern Australia.\n\n\n== Identifying features ==\nThis species can be recognized by its broad head, slender snout, and leafy appendages on its dorsal ridges. Its colour varies from dark grey to orange-brown with pale bars along the back and an orange blotch on the lower gill cover, with occasional sightings of pale or black individuals. It can grow to lengths of 16 centimetres (6.3 in).\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nFestucalex cinctus is endemic to Australia, found off the coast of Queensland and New South Wales. It is a secretive species which lives in sheltered coastal bays and estuaries, on patches of coral rubble, sand or in areas where there is a sparse growth of seagrass, algae and sponges, at depths of 8\u201331 metres (26\u2013102 ft). F. cinctus has been recorded in small numbers in the open water near to pilings of piers in harbours.\n\n\n== Biology ==\nFestucalex cinctus is demersal and is expected to feed on small crustaceans, similar to other pipefish. This species is ovoviviparous, with males carrying eggs and giving birth to live young. The males bear the fertilised eggs in a semi-enclosed pouch on the ventral side of the trunk, this pouch has distinct protective plates and its folds barely meet on the midline when it is full of eggs.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nFestucalex cinctus is a species of marine animal listed under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and which is protected under the New South Wales Fisheries Management Act. Specimens from the tropical part of its distribution, in northern Queensland and the Northern Territory, appear to be different from specimens in New South Wales and may represent a different species.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nFishes of Australia\nGovernment of Australia Department of the Environment and Energy"

"Paint| Paints| Painting materials| Coatings| ","Paint is any pigmented liquid, liquefiable, or solid mastic composition that, after application to a substrate in a thin layer, converts to a solid film. It is most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture. Paint can be made or purchased in many colors\u2014and in many different types. Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but most types dry into a solid. Most paints are either oil-based or water-based and each has distinct characteristics. For one, it is illegal in most municipalities to discard oil-based paint down household drains or sewers. Clean-up solvents are also different for water-based paint than they are for oil-based paint. Water-based paints and oil-based paints will cure differently based on the outside ambient temperature of the object being painted (such as a house.) Usually, the object being painted must be over 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F), although some manufacturers of external paints/primers claim they can be applied when temperatures are as low as 2 \u00b0C (35 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPaint was one of the earliest arts of humanity. Some cave paintings drawn with red or yellow ochre, hematite, manganese oxide, and charcoal may have been made by early Homo sapiens as long as 40,000 years ago. Paint may be even older. In 2003 and 2004, South African archeologists reported finds in Blombos Cave of a 100,000-year-old human-made ochre-based mixture that could have been used like paint. Further excavation in the same cave resulted in the 2011 report of a complete toolkit for grinding pigments and making a primitive paint-like substance.Interior walls at the 5,000-year-old Ness of Brodgar have been found to incorporate individual stones painted in yellows, reds, and oranges, using ochre pigment made of haematite mixed with animal fat, milk or eggs.Ancient colored walls at Dendera, Egypt, which were exposed for years to the elements, still possess their brilliant color, as vivid as when they were painted about 2,000 years ago. The Egyptians mixed their colors with a gummy substance and applied them separately from each other without any blending or mixture. They appear to have used six colors: white, black, blue, red, yellow, and green. They first covered the area entirely with white, then traced the design in black, leaving out the lights of the ground color. They used minium for red, generally of a dark tinge.\nThe oldest known oil paintings are Buddhist murals created circa 650 AD. The works are located in cave-like rooms carved from the cliffs of Afghanistan's Bamiyan Valley, \"

His widespread activity in the region made him an influential figure in New England and Boston classical music, especially choral music, in the latter half of the 19th century. He was especially successful in the presentation of the great oratorios and the management of large choruses.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe began the study of music in Rostock at the age of twelve years, and completed his education in Hanover and Berlin. The revolutions of 1848 motivated him to leave Europe, and with 25 others he organized The Germania Musical Society and went to the United States, giving concerts in London on the way. Zerrahn played first flute. The group reached New York City in September 1848 and gave successful concerts in New York and Brooklyn which were followed by others in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, and New England. They appeared for five or six years with Jenny Lind, Henriette Sontag, Ole Bull, Sigismund Thalberg, Alfred Ja\u00ebll, Camilla Urso, and other artists, disbanding in 1854 after giving 800 concerts during its career.\n\nZerrahn settled in Boston at the conclusion of the tour. From 1855 until 1863 he conducted a Boston \u201cPhilharmonic,\u201d one of several orchestras going by that name at that time.  Beginning in 1865, he led concerts for the Harvard Musical Association until the concerts were discontinued in 1882.  He conducted the Handel and Haydn Society 1854-1895, and he directed the Worcester Music Festival in Massachusetts for thirty years as well, 1866-1897. He was elected conductor of the Oratorio Society of Salem, Massachusetts in 1868, and conducted choral societies in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, Ogdensburg, New York, and other places.\nHe directed the choral forces for Patrick Gilmore's  National Peace Jubilee of 1869 and the World's Peace Jubilee and International Musical Festival of 1872. In 1869, this amounted to a chorus of 10,000; in 1872 the chorus was twice that size though in the latter case the results were not entirely satisfactory. He taught singing, harmony and composition at the New England Conservatory of Music until 1898, when he retired.Among the journals he edited were The Index, The Apograph, The Atlas, and Carl Zerrahn's Selections.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nHoward, John Tasker (1939).

"Hemicontinuity| Mathematical analysis| Continuous mappings| Variational analysis| ","In mathematics, the notion of the continuity of functions is not immediately extensible to multivalued mappings or correspondences between two sets A and B. \nThe dual concepts of upper hemicontinuity and lower hemicontinuity facilitate such an extension. \nA correspondence that has both properties is said to be continuous in an analogy to the property of the same name for functions.\nRoughly speaking, a function is upper hemicontinuous when (1) a convergent sequence of points in the domain maps to a sequence of sets in the range which (2) contain another convergent sequence, then the image of the limiting point in the domain must contain the limit of the sequence in the range. \nLower hemicontinuity

But this should be taken with appropriate care since, for example, there exists a pair of lower hemicontinuous correspondences whose intersection is not lower hemicontinuous. \nThis can be fixed upon strengthening continuity properties: if one of those lower hemicontinuous multifunctions has open graph then their intersection is again lower hemicontinuous.\nCrucial to set-valued analysis (in view of applications) are the investigation of single-valued selections and approximations to multivalued maps. \nTypically lower hemicontinuous correspondences admit single-valued selections (Michael selection theorem, Bressan\u2013Colombo directionally continuous selection theorem, Fryszkowski decomposable map selection). \nLikewise, upper hemicontinuous maps admit approximations (e.g. Ancel\u2013Granas\u2013G\u00f3rniewicz\u2013Kryszewski theorem).\n\n\n== Implications for continuity ==\nIf a correspondence is both upper hemicontinuous and lower hemicontinuous, it is said to be continuous. \nA continuous function is in all cases both upper and lower hemicontinuous.\n\n\n== Other concepts of continuity ==\nThe upper and lower hemicontinuity might be viewed as usual continuity:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u0393\n        :\n        A\n        \u2192\n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Gamma :A\\to B}\n   is lower [resp. upper] hemicontinuous if and only if the mapping \n  \n    \n      \n        \u0393\n        :\n        A\n        \u2192\n        P\n        (\n        B\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Gamma :A\\to P(B)}\n   is continuous where the hyperspace P(B) has been endowed with the lower [resp. upper] Vietoris topology.(For the notion of hyperspace compare also power set and function space).\nUsing lower and upper Hausdorff uniformity we can also define the so-called upper and lower semicontinuous maps in the sense of Hausdorff (also known as metrically lower / upper semicontinuous maps).\n\n\n== See also ==\nDifferential inclusion\nHausdorff distance\nMultivalued function \u2013 Generalization of a function that may produce several outputs for each input\nSemicontinuity\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAliprantis, Charalambos D.; Border, Kim C.

Under the direction of Thomas M. Owen its founder, the agency received state funding by an act of the Alabama Legislature on February 27, 1901. Its primary mission is the collecting and preserving of archives, documents and artifacts relating to the history of the state.  It was the first publicly funded, independent state archives agency in the United States.  It subsequently became a model for the establishment of archives in other states.  Today the agency identifies, preserves, and makes accessible records and artifacts significant to the history of the state and serves as the official repository for records created by Alabama's state agencies.\n\n\n== The building and exhibits ==\nThe Department of Archives and History was housed in the old Senate cloak room at the Alabama State Capitol after its establishment in 1901.  It was then moved to the Capitol's new south wing upon its completion in 1906.  A separate building was first conceived of in 1918 by Thomas McAdory Owen, the first director of the Archives.  However, funding did not become available until the 1930s, when the next director, Marie Bankhead Owen (wife of Thomas), was able to secure the necessary capital from the Works Progress Administration.The three-story Neoclassical building was built from 1938\u201340.  An east wing was completed in 1970 and a west one in 2005.  The west wing added 60,000 square feet (5,574 m2) of new space to the building.  The original Washington Avenue bronze entrance doors to the building were designed by artist Nathan Glick.  They depict eight scenes from Alabama history.  Following many years of wear they were relocated to the Ocllo S. Malone Lobby in the new west wing.  The first and second floors of the Archives building feature walls clad in white Alabama marble.The first floor contains the original Washington Avenue entrance lobby, which features a coffered ceiling with gilt moldings and ceiling medallions.  Other features of the first floor are the Statuary Hall, the Research Room, several auditoriums, a gift shop, and the Ocllo Malone Lobby.\n\n\n=== Museum of Alabama ===\nThe second and third floors contain the Museum of Alabama.  Portraits of people who contributed to the history of the state are hung in various locations on both of these floors.  The second floor contains exhibits featuring the Selma to Montgomery marches, the history of Native Americans in the state from the Pre-Columbian era to the Indian removal, and the history of warfare involving Alabamians from the French Colonial period to the Vietnam War.  The Alabama Sampler Gallery contains Alabama-related artifacts ranging from 19th century clothing to a guitar owned by Hank Williams.  The Hands-On Gallery contains history-related activities for children.  The third floor houses paintings and sculpture.\n\n\n== Directors ==\nThe department has had six directors since its inception.  Thomas McAdory Owen served from 1901 until his death in 1920.  He was succeeded by Marie Bankhead Owen, his wife, who served until her retirement in 1955.  Peter A. Brannon was director from 1955 to 1967, followed by Milo Howard.  Howard served until Edwin Bridges took over in 1982.  Bridges served until his retirement in 2012.

"Giovanni_Dandolo| 1289 deaths| House of Dandolo| 13th-century Doges of Venice| ","Giovanni Dandolo was the 48th Doge of Venice, elected late in his life on 31 March 1280, died on 2 November 1289. During his reign the first Venetian gold ducat was introduced into circulation.\n\n\n== Family ==\nDandolo came from a prominent Venetian family that provided three other doges to Venice: Enrico Dandolo, Francesco Dandolo and Andrea Dandolo. Two women from the Dandolo family married doges:  Giovanna Dandolo with Pasquale Malipiero and Zilia Dandolo with Lorenzo Priuli.\nDandolo is a distant relative of many famous figures in Italian history, such as Fra Angelico, Eugenio Canfari, Benito Mussolini. \nBut belonging to the branch of the parish of S. Mois\u00e8, he was the son of Giberto who had defeated the Genoese in the battle near Settepozzi, and of Maria of Gratone Dandolo of S. Polo. According to all the oldest genealogies his grandfather was called Giacomo: it is therefore to be considered a mistake of the most recent literature the attribution to him of the vicedoge Raniero as an ancestor and then of the Doge Enrico as great-grandfather.Giovanni Dandolo was married to some one named Caterina.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBefore his election as doge, Dandolo occupied various public positions including Podest\u00e0 of Bologna and Padua, and commander of the Venetian naval units. The news of his election to doge reached him while he was fighting in a military action against Istria and Trieste, which expanded into an open war in the following year, also involving Venice's perennial enemy, the Patriarchate of Aquileia and the Papal States. More armed clashes followed, and continued for the duration of Dandolo's reign as doge.\nAfter Dandolo signed the peace Treaty of Ravenna with Ancona, a new military theater opened through the revolt in Crete led by the Greek noble Alexios Kallergis and backed by the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII, Venice's rival for the domination of the eastern Mediterranean. These conflicts forced the Republic of Venice to negotiate peace agreements with Charles of Anjou and Philip III of France, concluding an alliance with the former in the Treaty of Orvieto.\nDuring Dandolo's reign as doge, relations with the Vatican were tense.  Venice had refused to join the Papal States in a punitive action against Sicily, provoking Pope Martin IV to excommunicate Venice, which was later repealed in 1285 by Martin's successor, Pope Honorius IV. In 1287 unrest flared up again in Istria and spread to Friuli. The war widened after the intervention of the German Emperor Rudolf I, who was allied with the Patriarchate of Aquileia, and Venice had to sue for peace.\n\nIn 1284, the first Venetian gold ducat, later called the Zecchino, was introduced into circulation. The ducat would be used until the end of the Venetian Republic and was always made with the same weight, 3.56 grams of 24 karat (99.7%) gold.  The coin was valid in all states with which Venice traded. The name ducat comes from the inscription on the coin's back:  Sit tibi Christe datus quem tu regis iste ducatus, which frames a picture of Christ. The front of each coin showed the ruling doges on their knees in front of the city's patron saint, Mark the Evangelist.\nDandolo was buried in San Zanipolo. The tomb was not preserved, only a stone slab with an inscription commemorates the doge.\n\n\n== References ==\nHelmut Dumler: Venedig und die Dogen. D\u00fcsseldorf 2001."

He was an important figure in the early history of the movement but later fell out of favour.\n\n\n== Falangism ==\nD\u00e1vila was a cousin of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera and as such was given the responsibility of expanding the operations of the Falange in Seville and C\u00e1diz in 1933. He soon rose to the rank of jefe territorial for Andalusia. He was a close ally of Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1inz Nothnagel and was arrested with him in May 1936 at Jos\u00e9 Antonio's house.\n\n\n== Power struggle ==\nFollowing the execution of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, D\u00e1vila joined with his ally Agust\u00edn Aznar in a power struggle for the leadership of the Falange. The two men led the legitimistas group within the movement which opposed the leadership of Primo de Rivera's nominated successor Manuel Hedilla. D\u00e1vila's presence was especially important to this group due to his familial connection and he was central in maintaining the cult of El Ausente (the absent), as Primo de Rivera was to be known. In the struggle that followed the legitimista militia seized power for themselves and on April 16, 1937 set up a triumvirate made up of  D\u00e1vila, Aznar and Jos\u00e9 Moreno at the head of the Falange. However, with the help of nazi German agent Carl von Haartman, Hedilla's forces recaptured the Falange HQ from D\u00e1vila and before long Francisco Franco stepped in, ostensibly to support Hedilla but in fact to create the Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista and thus effectively eliminate the Falange and its leaders as threats to his position. D\u00e1vila was imprisoned following the incident although his close friend Gonzalo Queipo de Llano intervened to secure his release.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nIn a snub from Franco, he was not named as a National Delegate until 1938 at a time when a number of pro-Nazis were added to this office. He was replaced as delegate to the Frente de Juventudes in 1941 by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Elola-Olaso as the influence of D\u00e1vila's ally Ram\u00f3n Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er began to wane.Between 1952 and 1954 he served as the President of the Royal Spanish Football Federation.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Sancho D\u00e1vila y Fern\u00e1ndez de Celis at Wikimedia Commons"

"Small_nucleolar_RNA_SNORD64| Small nuclear RNA| Molecular and cellular biology stubs| ","In molecular biology, SNORD64 (also known as HBII-13)  is a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecule which functions in the biogenesis (modification) of other small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). This type of modifying RNA is located in the nucleolus of the eukaryotic cell which is a major site of snRNA biogenesis. It is known as a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and also often referred to as a guide RNA.\nSNORD64 belongs to the C/D box class of snoRNAs which contain the conserved sequence motifs known as the C box (UGAUGA) and the D box (CUGA). Most of the members of the box C/D family function in directing site-specific 2'-O-methylation of substrate RNAs.snoRNA HBII-13 is expressed mainly in the tissues of brain, but is also in the lungs, the kidneys and muscle; however HBII-13 has no identified target RNA.\nThe HBII-13 gene is located in a 460 kb intron of the large paternally-expressed transcription unit (SNURF-SNRNP-UBE3A AS) along with several other snoRNAs HBII-436, HBII-437, HBII-438A/B and the clusters of HBII-85, HBII-52.

It had an estimated moment magnitude of 7.1\u20137.2 and a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe). The shock was centered near the Mexico\u2013United States border and takes its name from a large dry lake bed in Baja California, Mexico. There were no reported casualties, but the event affected the then largely-uninhabited areas of northern Mexico and Southern California.\n\n\n== Tectonic setting ==\n\nThe Salton Trough is part of the complex plate boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate where it undergoes a transition from the continental transform of the San Andreas Fault system to the series of short spreading centers of the East Pacific Rise linked by oceanic transforms in the Gulf of California. The southern part of the trough is divided into two by the Sierra Cucapa and Sierra Mayor ranges forming the Mexicali Valley to the east and the Laguna Salada to the west. The western side of these ranges is formed by the Laguna Salada Fault, which forms a possible continuation of the Elsinore Fault Zone of southern California.\nThe Laguna Salada Fault shows combined normal (down to the southwest) and dextral (right-lateral) movement. Prior to 2010 it showed evidence of recent (probably historical) displacement with a 22 km (14 mi) zone of surface faulting, and 3\u20134 m (9.8\u201313.1 ft) of vertical displacement. This is interpreted to be associated with the 1892 earthquake.\n\n\n== Earthquake ==\nThe earthquake was felt over a wide area from Los Angeles and San Bernardino in the north to San Quintin in the south. The area in which the perceived intensity of shaking reached VIII (Severe) or more was centered on the mapped fault rupture.\n\n\n=== Damage ===\nA report from the Los Angeles Times the following day stated no damage was found in Los Angeles, but also specified that severe shocks were felt in San Diego. Masonry walls were cracked in several buildings there, as well as the outlying communities of Otay and Jamul. At the abandoned Carrizo Creek Stage Station, in what is now Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in eastern San Diego county, poorly built masonry was damaged and all adobe buildings were destroyed. At Hook Ranch and Laguna Station the shaking was strong enough to throw people off their feet and at Dulzura Canyon and McCain Valley the ground was seen to move in waves. There were rockfalls at Bratton Valley, Tierra Blanca Canyon, Storm Canyon and Whale Peak and landslides at Dulzura Canyon and Devil's Canyon.\n\n\n=== Aftershocks ===\nAt Campo, California 155 aftershocks were felt in the first 12 hours after the mainshock and continued every few days for the next two months.\n\n\n== Other events ==\nThe Laguna Salada fault moved again during the 2010 Baja California earthquake.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of earthquakes in California\nList of earthquakes in the United States\nList of historical earthquakes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRupture Pattern of the 1892 Laguna Salada Earthquake: A Precursor to 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah \u2013 Southern California Earthquake Center"

"Kalam_language| Languages of Papua New Guinea| Kalam languages| Pandanus avoidance registers| ","Kalam is a Kalam language of Papua New Guinea. It is closely related to Kobon, and shares many of the features of that language.

"Sighthill,_Glasgow| Areas of Glasgow| Housing estates in Glasgow| Springburn| ","Sighthill is a neighbourhood in the Scottish city of Glasgow. It is situated north of the River Clyde and is part of the wider Springburn district in the north of the city. It is bordered to the north by Cowlairs, to the east by the Springburn Bypass road and the Royston neighbourhood, to the west by the Glasgow to Edinburgh via Falkirk Line (running into Queen Street Station) and to the south by the Townhead interchange of the M8 Motorway.\nThe district is primarily residential and from the mid-1960s consisted of a housing estate split into two sub-areas \u2013  Pinkston to the south and Fountainwell to the north \u2013 each with five 20-storey 'slab' tower blocks, plus seven 5-storey maisonette blocks and five rows of tenements in between. Most of these buildings were demolished in stages during the early 21st century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSighthill formed part of the Springburn Comprehensive Development Area (CDA), and was one of the 20 CDA's around the city where slum housing was completely demolished and replaced by new concrete housing estates based on contemporary architectural practices.  Designed by Crudens Ltd, the housing scheme was built by Glasgow Corporation Housing Department between 1964 and 1969 as part of the city's housing replacement programme \u2013 the existing housing in the area itself, consisting of tenements on Springburn Road and just off it at Huntingdon Place, was demolished in the process. Much of the land used for the Pinkston sector was known as the 'Soda Waste', derelict ground on which the United Alkali Company's St. Rollox Chemical Works, founded by Charles Tennant and at one time the largest chemical manufacturer in the world, used to dump waste chemicals (particularly hydrogen sulfide, a byproduct of the Leblanc process) until its closure in 1964. The Chemical Works was located on the north bank of the Monkland Canal, immediately east of Port Dundas. The Fountainwell sector was built on a farm of the same name, to the south of Sighthill Cemetery which opened in 1840. Within it stands the memorial to John Baird and Andrew Hardie, the leaders of the 1820 Radical War otherwise known as the 1820 Insurrection. William Mossman and his sculptor sons are buried here.\nThe Pinkston power station, which had supplied power to the city's tram system and the Subway, was closed in 1975, and its signature cooling tower which dominated the city's skyline was demolished in 1977, with the rest of the complex being removed the year after.\nThe Sighthill estate later suffered from stigma, as high-rise living went out of fashion. It suffered from low demand since the mid-1970s, despite its proximity to the city centre. Because of its low occupancy rate, Sighthill (along with nearby Red Road) was selected in the late 1990s as a temporary housing location for refugees and asylum seekers. As a result, the neighbourhood had one of the most diverse ethnic makeups in Scotland.\nIn 2005, letting was suspended in the Fountainwell side of Sighthill as new landlords, Glasgow Housing Association considered the estate's future. The decision was eventually made that Fountainwell should be demolished. The first two blocks were demolished in July 2008 with the three remaining blocks following in November 2009. Sighthill Primary School was also demolished after the tower blocks due to an arson attack shortly after it closed.\nThe fate of the five remaining Pinkston blocks was debated further. After a campaign by local residents, at least two of the blocks were to be retained and refurbished by Glasgow Housing Association, with three being demolished or sold to private developers. However, Glasgow then bid for the 2018 Youth Olympics and were added to the hosting shortlist, but the successful city had to have its Athletes Village prepared \u2013  this resulted in the total demolition of Sighthill's towers to accommodate a new low-rise revelopment. The bid was lost, but regeneration continued. The Sighthill 'Transformational Regeneration Area' includes a new school campus, landscaped green areas, enhanced pedestrian bridge to the city centre and better connectivity to the Forth and Clyde Canal, in addition to approximately 1,000 new housing units for sale, private rental and social rental (much of it marketed as 'NorthBridge' by developers Keepmoat).There is also an active Community Council consisting of several committed residents who aim to deal with issues affecting the Sighthill neighbourhood.\n\n\n== Sighthill stone circle ==\nSighthill hosts the first astronomically aligned stone circle built in Great Britain for 3,000 years, guided by Duncan Lunan. Built at the highest point of Sighthill Park, the stone circle has a vantage point over the surrounding areas. There are 17 stones in the circle \u2013 with 16 forming a circle 30 feet (9 metres) across, and the largest four-tonne stone in the centre. The Sighthill megalith was intended as a tribute to both the ancient megalith builders and the scientists who discovered their significance. It was renovated in the late 2010s along with the rest of the district.\n\n\n== Tower blocks ==\nEach block contained 228 flats (i.e. 2,280 residences in total across the 10 blocks); essentially each block was two towers, each with 19 habitable floors of six flats in a mirror-image of the other and a separate communal entrance, joined together at a central wall. They were 57.6 metres (189 ft) tall.\n\n\n=== Fountainwell ===\nIn order of Demolition\n\nEagle Heights (2-4 Fountainwell Place) Cruden 1 (demolished: 13 July 2008)\nBarony Heights (16-18 Fountainwell Place) Cruden 2 (demolished: 13 July 2008)\nTennant Heights (37-49 Fountainwell Avenue) Cruden 3 (demolished: 29 November 2009)\nPhoenix Heights (6-8 Fountainwell Square) Cruden 5 (demolished: 29 November 2009)\nSt. Rollox Heights (2-4 Fountainwell Terrace) Cruden 4 (demolished: 29 November 2009)\n\n\n=== Pinkston ===\nParson Heights (16-18 Pinkston Drive) (demolished June 2013)\nHuntingdon Heights (17-19 Pinkston Drive) (demolished September/October 2013)\nPinkston Heights (3-5 Pinkston Drive) (demolished April 2014)\nCrawfurd Heights (31-35 Pinkston Drive) (demolished March\u2013June 2016)\nHartfield Heights (32-34 Pinkston Drive) (demolished July\u2013October 2016)\n\n\n== See also ==\nGlasgow tower blocks\nList of tallest voluntarily demolished buildings\nTowers in the park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSighthill Stone Circle\nSighthill Community Council (on Facebook)\nWebsite of St Rollox, the local church\nWebsite of St Mungo, the local chapel\nSpringburn Virtual Museum"

"Internal_erosion| Dams| Erosion| ","Internal erosion is the formation of voids within a soil caused by the removal of material by seepage. It is the second most common cause of failure in levees and one of the leading causes of failures in earth dams, responsible for about half of embankment dam failures.Internal erosion occurs when the hydraulic forces exerted by water seeping through the pores and cracks of the material in the dam and/or foundation are sufficient to detach particles and transport them out of the dam structure.\nInternal erosion is especially dangerous because there may be no external evidence, or only subtle evidence, that it is taking place. Usually a sand boil can be found, but the boil might be hidden under water. A dam may breach within a few hours after evidence of internal erosion becomes obvious.\nPiping is a related phenomenon and is defined as the progressive development of internal erosion by seepage, appearing downstream as a hole discharging water.  Piping is induced by regressive erosion of particles from downstream and along the upstream line towards an outside environment until a continuous pipe is formed.\n\n\n== Internal erosion and the piping process ==\nAccording to the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD), there are four general failure modes for internal erosion of embankment dams and their foundations:\nThrough the embankment\nThrough the foundation\nEmbankment-into-foundation\nAssociated with through-penetrating structuresThe process of internal erosion occurs across four phases: initiation of erosion, progression to form a pipe, surface instability, and, lastly, initiation of a breach.  Internal erosion is also classified in four types, dependent on failure path, how the erosion initiates and progresses, and its location:\n\nConcentrated leak: seeping water erodes and enlarges a crack until a breach occurs.  The crack may not progress to the exit (albeit failure is still possible), but eventually the continued erosion forms a pipe or a sinkhole.\nBackward erosion: initiated at the exit point of the seepage path, this type of erosion occurs when the hydraulic gradient is sufficiently high to cause particle detachment and transport; a pipe forms backwards from the exit point until breach.\nSuffusion: occurs in soils with a wide range of particle sizes.  Finer soil particles are eroded through the voids between coarser particles.  Soils susceptible to suffusion are termed internally unstable.  Suffusion can only occur if the volume occupied by the finer particles is lower than the available void space between the coarse particles.\nSoil contact erosion: a phenomenon called sheet flow occurs at interfaces between coarse and fine soils.  Water seeps along the interface between the two soils, eroding the particles from the finer layer into the coarser layer.\n\n\n=== Concentrated leak ===\nConcentrated leaks occur when cracks form in the soil.  The cracks must be below reservoir level, and water pressure needs to be present to maintain the open pipe.  It is possible for water flow to cause the sides of the pipe to swell, closing it and thus limiting erosion.  Additionally, if the soil lacks sufficient cohesion to maintain a crack, the crack will collapse and concentrated leak erosion will not progress to a breach.  Cracks that allow concentrated leaks can arise due to many factors, including:\n\nCross-valley arching resulting in vertical stresses on the sides of the dam\nCore arching on the shoulders of the embankment\nDifferential settlement (above 0.2% differential, a crack forming is almost certain)\nSmall scale irregularities during core treatment (e.g. due to poor compaction)\nCracks and gaps adjacent to spillways or abutment walls or around conduits\nVarious environmental factors like desiccation, settlement during earthquakes, freezing, animal burrows, vegetation/roots.Longitudinal cracks arise from the spreading of the embankment, while transverse openings, which are much more common, are due to vertical settlement of the dam.  The hydraulic shear stress \u03c4c required for the initiation of concentrated leak erosion can be estimated using laboratory testing, such as the hole erosion test (HET).\n\n\n=== Backward erosion ===\n\nBackward erosion often occurs in non-plastic soils such as fine sands. It can occur in sandy foundations, within the dam or levee, or in cofferdams under high flood pressures during construction, causing unravelling at the downstream face. Backward erosion is most often exhibited by the presence of sand boils at the downstream side of dams. Experiments from Sellmeijer and co-workers have shown that backwards erosion initiates in a slot through the strata that overlays the eroding soil (e.g. through excavations or drainage ditches) and then progress in many, smaller pipes (less than 2mm in height) rather than a single one. The stability of the pipes is dependent on the head, and once this is larger than a critical value (0.3-0.5 of flow path length), the channel extends upstream. Beyond this, at any head greater than the critical value, erosion progresses until eventually the pipes break through to the upstream reservoir, at which point breach occurs. In order for backwards erosion to occur, the dam or levee body must form and maintain a \u2018roof\u2019 for the pipe.\n\n\n=== Suffusion ===\nSuffusion occurs when water flows through widely-graded or gap-graded, cohesionless soils. The finer particles are transported by seepage, and the coarse particles carry most of the effective stress. Suffusion can only occur provided the fine soil particles are small enough to pass between the coarse particles and do not fill the voids in the coarser soil. Water flow velocity must also be sufficient to transport those fine particles.\nSuffusion leads to increased permeability in the embankment core, greater seepage velocities and possibly hydraulic fractures. It can also lead to settlement  if it occurs in the dam foundation. Soils subject to suffusion also tend to be affected by segregation. The Kenney-Lau approach is a renowned method for the analysis of suffusion, which uses the particle size distribution to assess the internal stability of a soil, which directly affects the likelihood of suffusion occurring.\n\n\n=== Soil contact erosion ===\nSoil contact erosion occurs when sheet flow (water flow parallel to an interface) erodes fine soil in contact with coarse soil. Contact erosion is largely dependent on the flow velocity, which must be sufficient to detach and transport the finer particles, as well as the finer soil particles being able to pass through the pores in the coarse layer. When contact erosion is initiated, a cavity is formed, leading to a reduction of stress. The roof of the cavity then collapses; the collapsed material is transported away resulting in a larger cavity. The process continues until the formation of a sinkhole. It is possible for a cavity to not collapse; this will lead to backward erosion occurring.\nSoil contact erosion can occur between any granular layer and a finer soil such as in silt-gravel, and often results in a loss of stability, increases in pore pressure and clogging of the permeable layer. \nExperimental results show that close to the geometrical limit, the point at which the fine particles can just pass between the coarse particles(the filter criterion), erosion initiation and failure are much more likely.\n\n\n== Prevention using filters ==\nIt is possible to interrupt the process of internal erosion with the use of filters. Filters trap eroded particles while still allowing seepage, and are normally coarser and more permeable than the filtered soil. The type of filter required and its location is dependent on which zones of the dam are most susceptible to internal erosion. Per regulation, filters need to satisfy five conditions:\nRetention: the filter must limit or interrupt the transport of eroded soil particles.\nSelf-filtration: also defined as stability, the filter must be internally stable.\nNo cohesion: the filter must not have the ability to maintain cracks or the ability to cement.\nDrainage: the filter must be sufficiently permeable to allow water pressure to dissipate.\nStrength: the filter must be capable of transferring stresses within the dam without being crushed.\n\n\n== References =="

Knopf and starring Greer Garson, Michael Wilding and Fernando Lamas. It is based on the 1925 play The Last of Mrs. Cheyney by Frederick Lonsdale, and was not related to the Wilkie Collins novel The Law and the Lady. Previous film versions of the story had been made in 1929 and 1937.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nJane Hoskins (Garson) has worked most of her life as a lady's maid, and is currently employed by Lord Minden and his haughty wife Lady Sybil Minden. Lord Minden's younger twin brother, The Honourable Nigel Duxbury (Wilding) received only ten thousand pounds to his brother's five million because his brother was born five minutes before him and is therefore seen as being the elder sibling in the eyes of the law. Having squandered his money, Nigel sneaks into his brother's home and steals Lady Minden's earrings. Lady Minden accuses her maid Jane of the theft until Nigel steps forward and claims responsibility. Jane is angry at being wrongly accused of theft by her employer and decides to quit her job and make her way into high society.\nNigel is impressed by Jane's attitude and, after securing the earrings in return for never bothering his brother again, he offers to take Jane out for an evening of fine dining. Together they unintentionally con a wealthy gentleman into believing that Jane is a wealthy widow, the Lady Lovely, and that she collects donations for a fictional Egyptian charity called The Nile Fund. At the end of the night, one hundred pounds wealthier, Jane makes a business arrangement with Nigel that the two of them should work together as confidence tricksters.\nJane and Nigel travel to Monte Carlo, San Remo and Shanghai, where they cheat at gambling and are repeatedly asked by the authorities to leave the country. Eventually they make their way to San Francisco, where Nigel suggests they move into jewellery theft. Nigel gets himself a job as a butler named Hoskins in the house of society queen Julia Wortin (Marjorie Main), and Jane befriends Mrs Wortin and is invited to the house as a guest. The two plan to lift Julia's diamond necklace during their stay.\nJulia throws a party in Jane's honour and her exotic neighbor Juan (Lamas) begins to woo Jane. Jane becomes somewhat swept off her feet at Juan's attentions to her, causing Nigel to become jealous. On the first night of her stay, Jane locates Julia's safe and the necklace, but is touched by the lady's kindness towards her and has second thoughts about their plan, so she does not go through with it. The following day Jane receives a proposal from Juan and decides to accept. Jane and Nigel argue about Jane's decision, and although they share a kiss, they are reluctant to admit their feelings for one another, having long ago agreed that theirs was a strictly business relationship.\nJane decides to steal the necklace and give it to Nigel because she is worried about his future now that she will no longer be his partner in crime. Juan sees her give the necklace to Nigel and has already discovered that she is not really Lady Lovely. Juan and his servant apprehend Nigel, and Juan forces himself into Jane's room, where she activates the burglar alarm. Realising that Juan is not going to give her away, Jane reveals that she is a thief to Julia. Nigel turns up with a letter from one of Julia's other house guests which contains libelous information with which he and Jane can blackmail Julia and her guests if they decide to turn Jane and Nigel over to the police. The guests bid for ownership of the libelous letter, but Jane decides to give it to Juan for free for his kindness. Julia thinks the whole evening has been a bit of excitement and asks Jane and Nigel to stay on.\nThe following morning, after fighting over Jane the night before, Juan and Nigel inform Jane that they have decided Juan should be the one she ends up with. Jane reveals her true love for Nigel by yelling at him for letting her down and revealing that she has always loved him but that he was \"

She is most known for her play By the Pike's Wish (1936).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nYelizaveta Tarakhovskaya (born Parnokh) was born in the city of Taganrog on July 26, 1891 in a pharmacist's family. She is sister to poet Sophia Parnok and twin sister to founder of Soviet Russian jazz Valentin Parnakh. She graduated from the Taganrog Girls Gymnasium, later studied in Bestuzhev courses in Saint Petersburg and started to write poems in her childhood.\n\nIn 1925, her first books were published: On How Chocolate Came to MosSelProm and Tit Will Fly. Since then, she wrote many children's books, including Metropolitan (1932), The Moon and the Lazy Fellow (1933), The Seagull (1965, dedicated to Valentina Tereshkova, Soviet Russian cosmonaut, the first woman to go into space). She is the author of poems for grown-ups: The Violin Clef (1958), The Bird (1965). The verses of Tarakhovskaya are lyrical, thoughtful, and almost always full of humor, with most of them being the poetry of ordinary and everyday things around.\nYelizaveta Tarakhovskaya translated into Russian many poems for children written by various Soviet and foreign authors: verses of Polish poet Julian Tuwim, Uzbek poet Kuddus Muhammadi (Muhammadiev), Azerbaijani poet Mirvari Dilbazi, Georgian poet Mariki Baratashvili(\u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\u10d9\u10d0 \u10d1\u10d0\u10e0\u10d0\u10d7\u10d0\u10e8\u10d5\u10d8\u10da\u10d8), Lithuanian poet Eduardas Mie\u017eelaitis, Bulgarian poet Assen Bossev and many more.\nToday Tarakhovskaya is probably most known for her play By the Pike's Wish, which was staged by Sergey Obraztsov in the Moscow State Academic Puppet Show named after Serguei Obraztsov in November 1936 and has remained in the theater's repertoire ever since. The play By the Pike's Wish (Po shchuchuyemu veleniyu) is considered by theater experts as the greatest puppet show of the 20th century, making quintessence of Meyerhold's methods. It was also released as a motion picture in 1938 (directed by Aleksandr Rou).\nYelizaveta Tarakhovskaya died in Moscow on November 11, 1968 and was buried on Novodevichy Cemetery near her twin-brother Valentin.A memorial plaque dedicated to Parnok family was placed on the wall of their birth house in Taganrog in 2012.\n\n\n== Works (alphabetical list) ==\n\n12 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u043f\u044f\u0442\u0438 /  \u041c.: \u0413\u0438\u0437, 1930.\n\u0411\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043d! / \u041c.: \u041c\u043e\u043b. \u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u044f, 1932.\n\u0411\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043d! / \u041c.: \u0413\u0438\u0437, 1930.\n\u0411\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043d! / \u0418\u0437\u0434. 3-\u0435. \u041c.: \u041c\u043e\u043b. \u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u044f, 1930.\n\u0412\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 / \u041c.; \u041b.: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442, 1937.\n\u0413\u0434\u0435 \u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0445\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430? / \u041c.; \u041b.: \u0413\u0438\u0437, 1930.\n\u0414\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0430 /\u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442: \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u0423\u0437. \u0421\u0421\u0420, 1942.\n\u0416\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430 / \u041c.: \u0413. \u0424. \u041c\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432, 1928.\n\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u0432 \u0441\u0430\u0434 / \u041c.; \u041b.: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0433\u0438\u0437, 1949.\n\u041a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b \u0432 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0435 / \u041c.: \u0413\u0438\u0437, 1930.\n\u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044f, \u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f / \u041b.: \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0433\u0430, 1929.\n\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e / \u041c.: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0433\u0438\u0437, 1951.\n\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e. \u0418\u0437\u0434. 3-\u0435. \u041c.; \u041b.: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442, 1938.\n\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043d / \u041c.: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0433\u0438\u0437, 1935.\n\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043d / \u0418\u0437\u0434. 2-\u0435. \u041c.: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442, 1936.\n\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043d / \u041c.: \u041c\u043e\u043b. \u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u044f, 1932.\n\u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043c / \u0418\u0437\u0434. 2-\u0435. \u041c.; \u041b.: \u041c\u043e\u043b. \u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u044f, 1931.\n\u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043c / 1928.\n\u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043c / \u041c.; \u041b.: \u0413\u0438\u0437, 1930.\n\u041e \u0442\u043e\u043c, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043b \u0448\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0434 \u0432 \u041c\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c /\u0420\u044f\u0437\u0430\u043d\u044c: \u0418\u0437\u0434. \"

"Trifluoromethylation| Organic reactions| ","Trifluoromethylation in organic chemistry describes any organic reaction that introduces a trifluoromethyl group in an organic compound. Trifluoromethylated compounds are of some importance in pharmaceutical industry and agrochemicals. Several notable pharmaceutical compounds have a trifluoromethyl group incorporated: fluoxetine, mefloquine, Leflunomide, nulitamide, dutasteride, bicalutamide, aprepitant, celecoxib, fipronil, fluazinam, penthiopyrad, picoxystrobin, fluridone, norflurazon, sorafenib and triflurazin. A relevant agrochemical is trifluralin. The development of synthetic methods for adding trifluoromethyl groups to chemical compounds is actively pursued in academic research.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first to investigate trifluoromethyl groups in relationship to biological activity was F. Lehmann in 1927. An early review appeared in 1958. An early synthetic method was developed by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Swarts in 1892, based on antimony fluoride. In this reaction benzotrichloride was reacted with SbF3 to form PhCF2Cl and\nPhCF3. In the 1930s Kinetic Chemicals and IG Farben replaced SbF3 with HF.\nThe McLoughlin-Thrower reaction (1968) is an early coupling reaction using iodofluoroalkanes, iodoaromatic compounds and copper. In 1969 Kobayashi & Kumadaki adapted their protocol for trifluoromethylations.\n\n\n== Reagents ==\n\n\n=== Trifluoromethyltrimethylsilane ===\nPreparation of the trifluoromethyltrimethylsilane was reported by Ingo Ruppert in 1984. In 1989, Prakash and Olah first reported activation of TMSCF3 by fluoride to perform nucleophilic trifluoromethylation of carbonyl compounds. In the same year, Stahly described similar reactions for the synthesis of trifluoromethylated phenols and anilines. Since then TMSCF3 has been widely used as a nucleophilic trifluoromethylating agent.An example is the trifluoromethylation of cyclohexanone in THF using tetrabutylammonium fluoride.\nThe substrates can be aryl halides. Potassium (trifluoromethyl)trimethoxyborate for this purpose has been synthesised from B(OMe)3, CF3SiMe3 and KF. Aryl functionalization by C-H activation has also been reported.\n\n\n=== Sodium trifluoroacetate ===\nSodium trifluoroacetate as a reagent for trifluoromethylations was introduced by Matsui in 1981. In the original scope the substrate was an aromatic halide and the metal salt copper(I)iodide.\n\n\n=== Trifluoromethane ===\nFluoroform (CF3H) has been employed as a trifluoromethylation reagent for aldehydes in combination with a strong base\n\n\n=== Trifluoroiodomethane ===\nTrifluoroiodomethane is a reagent in aromatic coupling reactions. It has also been used with enones, for example with chalcone, a reaction catalysed by diethyl zinc and Wilkinson's catalyst:\n\n\n=== Trifluoromethyl sulfone ===\nTrifluoromethyl sulfone (PhSO2CF3) and trifluoromethyl sulfoxide (PhSOCF3) can be used for trifluoromethylations of electrophiles\n\n\n=== Trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride ===\nTrifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride (or triflyl chloride, CF3SO2Cl) can be used in a highly efficient method to introduce a trifluoromethyl group to aromatic and heteroaromatic systems, including known pharmaceuticals such as Lipitor. The chemistry is general and mild, and uses a photoredox catalyst and a light source at room temperature.\n\n\n=== Sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate ===\nSodium trifluoromethanesulfinate (CF3SO2Na) as a trifluoromethylation reagent was introduced by Langlois in 1991. The reaction requires t-butyl hydroperoxide and generally a metal and proceeds through a radical mechanism. The reagent has been applied with heterocyclic substrates\n\n\n=== Umemoto reagents ===\nUmemoto reagents are (trifluoromethyl)dibenzoheterocyclic salts.\n\n\n=== Trifluoromethyl-metal reagents ===\nMany CF3-containing metal complexes have been prepared, and some are useful for trifluoromethylation. The most obvious reagent is CF3Li, which can be generated by lithium-iodide exchange.  This compound is however unstable even at low temperatures.  It degrades to lithium fluoride and difluorocarbene.  Trifluoromethyl copper(I) reagents are more useful.  These reagents are generated in situ by reaction of CF3I with copper powder in polar solvents.   Hg(CF3)2, prepared by decarboxylation of the trifluoroacetate, has proven useful for the trifluoromethylation of other metals.\n\n\n== Reaction types ==\n\n\n=== Aromatic coupling reactions ===\nIn coupling reactions between aromatic compounds and metal-trifluoromethyl complexes the metal is usually copper, Pd and Ni are less prominent. The reactions are stoichiometric or catalytic. In the McLoughlin-Thrower reaction (1962) iodobenzene reacts with trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I) and copper powder  in dimethylformamide at 150 \u00b0C to trifluoromethylbenzene. The intermediate in this reaction type is a perfluoromethyl-metal complex.\nA palladium acetate catalysed reaction described in 1982 used zinc powder with the main intermediate believed to be CF3ZnI with Pd(0) is the active catalyst. The first copper catalysed coupling was reported in 2009 and based on an iodoarene, a trifluoromethylsilane, copper iodide and 1,10-phenanthroline. Variations include another CF3 donor potassium (trifluoromethyl)trimethoxyborate, the use of aryl boronic acids or the use of a trifluoromethyl sulfonium salt or the use of a trifluoromethylcopper(I) phenanthroline complex. A catalytic palladium catalysed reaction was reported in 2010 using aryl halides, (trifluoromethyl)triethylsilane and allylpalladium chloride dimer\n\n\n=== Radical trifluoromethylation ===\nIn radical trifluoromethylation the active species is the trifluoromethyl free radical. Reagents such as bromotrifluoromethane and haloform have been used for this purpose but in response to the Montreal Protocol alternatives such as trifluoroiodomethane have been developed as replacement. One particular combination is CF3I / triethylborane\nOther reagents that generate the CF3 radical are sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate and bis(trifluoroacetyl) peroxide.\n\nIn the CF3 radical the fluorine atom is an electron-withdrawing group via the inductive effect but also a weak pi donor through interaction of the fluorine lone pair with the radical center's SOMO. Compared to the methyl radical the CF3 radical is pyramidal (angle 107.8 \u00b0C ) with a large inversion barrier, electrophilic and also more reactive. In reaction with styrene it is 440 times more reactive. An early report (1949) describes the photochemical reaction of iodotrifluoromethane with ethylene to 3-iodo-1,1,1-trifluoropropane. Reagents that have been reported for the direct trifluoromethylation of arenes are CF3I, CF3Br (thermal or photochemical), silver trifluoroacetate/TiO2 (photochemical) and sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate/Cu(OSO2CF3)2/tBuOOH.\n\n\n=== Nucleophilic trifluoromethylation ===\nIn nucleophilic trifluoromethylation the active species is the CF3\u2212 anion. It was, however, widely believed that the trifluoromethyl anion is a transient species and thus cannot be isolated or observed in the condensed phase.  Contrary to the popular belief, the CF3 anion, with [K(18-crown-6)]+ as a countercation, was produced and characterized by Prakash and coworkers. The challenges associated with observation of CF3 anion are alluded to its strong basic nature and its tendency to form pentacoordinated silicon species, such as [Me3Si(CF3)2]\u2212 or [Me3Si(F)(CF3)]\u2212.\nThe reactivity of fluoroform in combination with a strong base such as t-BuOK with carbonyl compounds in DMF is an example. Here CF3\u2212 and DMF form an hemiaminolate adduct ([Me2NCH(O)CF3]K).\n\n\n=== Electrophilic trifluoromethylation ===\nIn electrophilic trifluoromethylation the active trifluoromethyl donor group carries a positive charge. Production of an CF3+ cation has been described as \"

His father, Friedrich von Frankenberg, was a German baron of independent means, while his mother, Jessie Elliot, was the daughter of a wealthy Australian industrialist family. Her family owned property in Algeria, where her father resided there for lengthy periods, and the young family spent some time in North Africa. This may be where Von Frankenberg first encountered Islam. He later became an Officer for the German Crown Prince, and developed an interest in collecting rare works on Eastern and Islamic literature.In 1925 and 1926 he attended the Sufi Movement Summer School, led annually by Inayat Khan at Suresnes, in France. He was accepted by Khan as a student (mureed), and given the Sufi name of Momin (meaning faithful), as well as instruction in spiritual practices.In 1927, Von Frankenberg immigrated to Australia. His mother had inherited a substantial estate from her father, but it had been frozen during World War I because Elliot and her son were German nationals.

"Lithuanian_Heavy_Draught| Horse breeds| Horse breeds originating in Lithuania| ","The Lithuanian Heavy Draught is a draught horse breed created in Lithuania during the 19th and 20th centuries. They are used mainly for heavy draught and farm work, as well as meat production and the improvement of other breeds.  The breed is currently near extinction..\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Lithuanian Heavy Draught was created during the late 19th century by crossing local Zhmud mares with Ardennes, Percheron, Brabant, and other heavy breeds.  The breeding was overseen by the Lithuanian Society for Breeding Work and Driving Horses beginning in 1894.  In 1923 additional heavy horses were imported from the Netherlands to re-establish the breed following World War I, and in 1925, 2000, and 2001 additional Ardennes horses were imported from Sweden.Initially, Lithuanian Heavy Draughts were included into herd books as Ardennes crossbreds.  A breed-specific herd book was issued from 1951 to 1996. The herd books for Lithuanian Heavy Draughts are now issued by the Lithuanian Horse Breeders Association, with purebred Lithuanian Draughts identified by their colour, conformation, and markings. In 1964 there were 62,000 Lithuanian Heavy Draughts in Lithuania. Recently, there has been a dramatic decrease in the breed population, with stallion numbers declining and breeding and working conditions deteriorating.  Currently, the breed is close to extinction, with less than 1000 horses thought to exist as of 2003.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe Lithuanian Heavy Draught generally stands 15 to 16 hands high, and may be bay, chestnut, black, grey or roan. Overall the breed is large and solid.  The head is well-proportioned with a straight profile and heavy jaw.  The neck is short, muscular, and arched, the withers broad and moderately pronounced and the chest wide, deep and muscular.  The back is long, and generally straight, although it can be slightly dipped, and the croup rounded, long and muscled.  The legs are short, solid, and muscular with broad, strong joints and well-formed hooves.  Defects occasionally shown include a coarse head and an excessively dipped back.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nThe Lithuanian Heavy Draught is used mainly for heavy draught and farm work. In Lithuania draught capacity testing began in 1857, and since 2002 the Lithuanian Horse Breeders Association has taken over the responsibility of heavy horse testing.  Recently, more have begun to be exported for meat. They are also used to improve other breeds.  When crossed with native Altai horses, they improved the meat and milk yield and also increased the weight, growth rate, and ability to withstand year-round grazing conditions.\n\n\n== References =="
"Global_game| Game theory game classes| ","In economics and game theory, global games are games of incomplete information where players receive possibly-correlated signals of the underlying state of the world. Global games were originally defined by Carlsson and van Damme (1993).The most important practical application of global games has been the study of crises in financial markets such as bank runs, currency crises, and bubbles. However, they have other relevant applications such as investments with payoff complementarities, beauty contests, political riots and revolutions, and any other economic situation which displays strategic complementarity.\n\n\n== Global games in models of currency crises ==\nStephen Morris and Hyun Song Shin (1998) considered a stylized currency crises model, in which traders observe the relevant fundamentals with small noise, and show that this leads to the selection of a unique equilibrium. This result overturns the result in models of complete information, which feature multiple equilibria.\nOne concern with the robustness of this result is that the introduction of a theory of prices in global coordination games may reintroduce multiplicity of equilibria. This concern was addressed in Angeletos and Werning (2006) as well as Hellwig and coauthors (2006). They show that equilibrium multiplicity may be restored by the existence of prices acting as an endogenous public signal, provided that private information is sufficiently precise.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJorge, Jos\u00e9; Rocha, Joana (2015). \"
"99p_Stores| British companies established in 2001| British companies disestablished in 2016| Arts and crafts retailers| Defunct retail companies of the United Kingdom| Variety stores| Retail companies established in 2001| Retail companies disestablished in 2016| Discount shops of the United Kingdom| ","99p Stores Ltd. was a family-run business founded in January 2001 by entrepreneur Nadir Lalani, who opened the first store in the chain in Holloway, London, with a further three stores opening later that year. In 2002, Lalani decided to expand the business throughout the UK and had rapidly developed 99p Stores, operating a total of 129 stores as of March 2010 and serving around 1.5 million customers each week, undercutting their main rival Poundland by a penny. As of mid-2009 the company offered more than 3,500 different product lines throughout its stores.Most of their stores were based in the south of the UK, although there were stores as far north as Liverpool and Hartlepool. The chain saw accelerated store expansion upon the collapse of Woolworths Group, where they took the opportunity to acquire 15 of these former stores, increasing their estate to 79 at that time. Landlords were regarding 99p Stores as an anchor tenant due to the significant number of customers one of their stores could bring to a location.Although the retailer made a pre-tax loss of \u00a31.14 million in the year to 31 January 2007, they claimed that, since then, consumers had become more cautious with their money and where they spend it, in response to the economic conditions. The retailer had noticed an increase of customers from the wealthier AB social grade (a system of demographic classification used in the United Kingdom) during the recession. Customers had tended to speak positively about 99p Stores, with most reviewers noting customer and product overcrowding as their biggest criticisms, yet still rated the chain 4.5/5 on average.In February 2015, Poundland agreed to buy 99p Stores for \u00a355 million, with regulatory approval received in September 2015. The 99p Stores fascia began being phased out in favour of Poundland branding from late 2015.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\n\nNadir Lalani came to the UK in 1973 from Tanzania, having owned a cash and carry store in Mwanza. Since moving to the UK he built up and sold two convenience store chains (including buying Whistlestop Discount Stores, a 27-strong chain which he sold in 2005) before moving into discount retailing, with intentions of handing the business over to his two sons, who also work for the company, in due course. Lalani was inspired to start 99p Stores after stumbling upon a bustling Poundland shop whilst wandering around a shopping centre. His first store opened on 18 January 2001, with over 3,500 customers visiting the store in the first day of trading. As of mid-2009, the company offered more than 3,500 different product lines throughout its stores.\n\n\n=== Growth ===\nThe company relocated their headquarters to a new, 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2) base in Daventry in 2007, giving them capacity to go to 120 stores with existing infrastructure. Discount shops, including 99p Stores, had seen store numbers increase by 60% during the economic downturn, with two discount stores opening for every one store that has closed. The retailer took advantage of the tough economic climate of the late 2000s, having doubled the number of their stores during the period August 2008 - August 2009, and had further plans to double existing store numbers and current market share within the 18 months following October 2009.In August 2009, Retail Week reported that the retailer was to review its ownership structure, potentially resulting in a sale as early as summer 2010 or a flotation within the next three years. The retailer had said they would want 150 shops before considering any offers to buy a stake in the business, mentioning the advantages of a flotation to include further investment, as well as the Lalani family being able to retain a stake and an element of control in the business.\n\n\n=== Management ===\nIn October 2009, the retailer appointed Gordon Brown as their new chairman, who took up the position on 1 October 2009, taking over from Peter Gent. Brown, having previously served as managing director at Wilkinson between 1991 and 2007, joined the company at a time when it was embarking on aggressive expansion and assessing its long-term options.\n\n\n== Business practice ==\n\n\n=== Sales strategy ===\nWhen inflation pushes up prices beyond what the company is able to pay, this is often easily worked around by reducing the quantity supplied in each item, for example by reducing the amount of tape on reels of selotape, or selling eggs by the dozen instead of 18s. Nadir's son and buying director, Faisal, who took care of the day-to-day running, noted that the lowest margin he will work with is 20 percent. In response to the planned VAT rise to 20% in January 2011, the budget chain said it would not change its prices but would stop selling goods that did not make a profit.Towards the end of 2009, 99p Stores replaced their Torex electronic point of sale system with one provided by Futura to operate their touchscreen Intelligent Registers (IRs). As well as allowing the retailer to understand which products customers are buying, through up-to-date tracking of the most popular products, it allowed stock to be moved around the business quickly. Other functionality included its allocation and replenishment capabilities, helping to ensure constant stock via automated ordering. Following a successful pilot (in which the company tested the new system in a select number of stores before committing to it), Futura scheduled an ambitious roll-out programme at the end of 2009 to change both software and platform, reducing the normal roll-out period from six months to two months. The Futura team installed the system with Digipos touch-screen tills each evening after trading, enabling the store to start trading the very next day. Simultaneously, new chip-and-pin capability was being introduced, to ensure the company is PCI compliant, with contactless payments to follow.\n\n\n=== Products offered ===\n\nThe retailer offered a large range of products in its 3,500 lines, from \"

"Vermilacinia_johncassadyi| Lichens described in 1996| Fungi of Mexico| Lichens| Ramalinaceae| ","Vermilacinia johncasadyi is a rare fruticose lichen, found on rocks along the Pacific Coast of Baja California peninsula on Punta Cono, and directly westward across the ocean on Cedros Island.\n\n\n== Distinguishing features ==\nVermilacinia johncassadyi is classified in the subgenus Vermilacinia, distinguished from related species by its thallus divided into strap-like branches arising from a blackened base to about \u00bc the way up the branches, and by producing lichen substances of triterpenes referred to as T1 and T2 in reference to their Rf class on thin-layer chromatography plates.  Apothecia, which develop in some thalli, occur in terminal clusters, sometimes extending down along the branch margins. The strap-like branches are recurved in forms that produce apothecia, and erect in forms lacking apothecia.\nVermilacinia laevigata is morphologically similar to V. johncassadyi in its strap-like branches.  It differs in its lichen substances (contains T3, not T1 and T2), and development of its apothecia elevated from the branch by a short narrower stalk-like lobe, in contrast to apothecia in V.  johncassadyi that appear to pinch off from the branch margins, occurring in aggregate and often not fully developed, the margins notably wavy as a result.\nThe species was named after a chemist, John Cassady, who was Chairman of the Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy at Purdue University, and later Dean of the School of Pharmacy at Ohio State University while the species was under investigation.  He, and his graduate student, Thomas McCloud, had accompanied Richard Spjut on an expedition to Baja California during May 1986 for the collection of plant and lichen samples in search of new chemical compounds for treating cancer.\n\n\n== Lichen substances ==\nVermilacinia johncasadyi contains predominantly terpenes but lacks the T3 compound as noted above, and also lacks accessory depsidones such as salazinic acid. It is one of a small number of species in the genus with a distinctive chemistry of secondary triterpenes referred to as T1 and T2. These triterpenes are found only in subgenus Vermilacinia, and only in species that occur in the central region of Baja California.  Their chemical formulas were identified by mass spectrometry, C30H50O2  (T1) and C30H50OO (T2) from extraction of 350 grams of a 400 gram sample of Vermilacinia cedrosensis. Some material of V. reptilioderma was in the sample. In thin-layer chromatography (TLC), these compounds are so prominent that they appear to displace zeorin and [16R,(-)]-16 \u03b1-hydroxykaurane, appearing as a smear up the TLC plate.\n\n\n== Taxonomic history ==\nVermilacinia johncasadyi was first discovered along the northwest coast of Cedros Island on vertical rock faces about 500 feet directly above the ocean, 12 April 1989, and described as a new species in 1996 (Spjut & Marin 10535, holotype US)Peter Bowler and Janet Marsh in 2004 indicated that Vermilacinia johncasadyi was an \"
